Task 1:

 Total words in vocab : 4745 + 3
 The vocabulary is obtained by counting words in training and unlabeled set and discarding words that are which have a count <10.
 and adding UNK + start tag + end tag

 Along the way, try to identify some things you were making overcomplicated in your own preprocessing in previous assignments.
 - we tried to remove special characters, convert all the words to lower case etc etc < fill here>
 - the only preprocessing this does is to
 1. Discard words that are repeated less than 10 times,
 2. Add start and end
 3. Get indices of word in each sentence.

Task 2:

  The training loss decreases as the number of epoches incr. But Validation accuracy decreases as the epoches increase proving overfitting of data.

Task 3:
    Dropout seems to have helped and the overfitting isn't as much.

Task 4:
    No back propogation in validation loss calculation - don't see anything else !

Task 5: Values stored in lab.txt and u_lab.txt
