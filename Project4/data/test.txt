POS	we cut to camille ( glenn close ) who is obsessively directing a play with her sister cora ( julianne moore ) .

POS	the glaring pastel colours worn by the performers is an interesting touch .
POS	brendan fraser's stuck in the past again , but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo alicia silverstone . . .
POS	and another soon-to-be-classic is actually divided in two : the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail , which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year .
NEG	he also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain .
POS	irons plays him to a cold perfection , with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence .
NEG	don't go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece .
POS	the first film showed some horrible results of corleone's life .
NEG	macnee's steed was a witty man of the world with a sense of humor .
POS	the scenes of ed's family sitting around the dinner table feasting on kentucky fried chicken and waxing idiotic play like a big-budget variant on that film , paralleling its wickedly inventive humor .
NEG	on the other hand , emotions are much better played by confronting law-abiding , yet ethnically stereotyped citizens with their daily nemesis of street punks - ruthless enough to exercise their reign of terror on the entire city blocks , and stupid enough to be killed in droves by kersey .
NEG	alas , these are only hints .
POS	mr . buscemi is off to a good career as a director !
NEG	from beginning to end , there's not a laugh to be found .
POS	" palmetto " is a generous amount of fun to watch , and that's all you need to know .
POS	but here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film , making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that 9 years .
NEG	its 100-minute running time feels like 100 years .
POS	i would say that it is in the genre of betty blue ( 37 . 2 le matin ) and bitter moon ( lunes de fiel ) .
NEG	you add a high school environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds , and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 90 minutes , the typical teenage attention span .
POS	while the premise of both may be the = same , execution and focus of the films will in fact show that deep = impact has more focus on human elements than armageddon , which is done = by the team which brought us bad boys , crimson tide and the rock .
POS	the story is basically classic by now , repeated almost as many times as kurosawa's " the seven samurai " : a pair of twins ( played here by lindsay lohan , just like they were played by hayley mills in the original ) are separated at birth by their divorcing parents .
NEG	isolated as an individual text , the x-files can stand alone .
NEG	with the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end , there isn't a sequence in this film that raises the pulse .
NEG	but even after an hour of half-stated political statements and murky mass killings , we * still * don't know enough of what's happening in this country to feel distressed for the characters or their situations .
NEG	and as further background , a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe .
POS	cameron could as well have called his picture " the never ending love " or " love at first sight " , as he concentrates all his energy on the young couple , and not on the disaster itself .
POS	being very loosely based on the same book the 1973 thriller " the day of the jackal " , comparison between the two films is inevitable .
POS	bridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons : to look sexy in a bikini , to provide a little twisted comedy , and to satisfy tarantino's foot fetish .
POS	and i would not be surprised if , ten years from now , contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction .
POS	others will mention meg ryan .
POS	chris elliot , as the cameraman larry , is also funny , although you have to like his goofy style , otherwise you are really going to hate him throughout this film , and it will lower your enjoyment of the film overall .

NEG	freshly moved to atlanta , jermaine ( dourdan ) and his wife , jasmine ( moore ) , have the trappings of a perfect life .
NEG	he wants a warm , fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman's flute-and-wind musical score , and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background .
POS	along with " man bites dog , " and perhaps something by woody allen , this is the best movie i've ever seen .
NEG	he is supposed to bring laughs for the kidlets , but even at age five i would have cringed while watching him .
POS	as it turns out , the laserman _is_ about crime and about laser beams , but there aren't any superheroes .
NEG	frank is such a slob , so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child .
NEG	but the way that he chooses to do it is tasteless .

NEG	mr . schumacher is a good director .
NEG	this is not deep impact ? it's a frivolous cheap impact .
POS	director liman ( who also photographed go ) and screenwriter august celebrate the drug/rave scene in l . a . , preferring to take ( comedic ) snapshots of troubled youth rather than critique them .
NEG	obstacles are put in the crew's way and and they matter-of- factly go about solving them .
POS	the solution lies no farther away than the second blatant reminder of the master scribe : patrick verona ( heath ledger ) .
NEG	one , for example , sees her as an aztec priestess holding out a large heart that she had just cut from a body .
POS	bille august's high-profile adaptation of victor hugo's classic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from a classy hollywood epic--handsome production values , strong performances by a top-notch cast , a literate screenplay--with one critically missing element : emotional sweep .
NEG	the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing , which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the _real_ source material , the dashiell hammett novel _red harvest_ .
NEG	only the opportunity to talk with the filmmakers afterwards made the movie bearable .

NEG	apparently , just their wardrobes .
NEG	the film tells the story of a low-budget horror movie being filmed at the closed-down crippen high , a school where a group of serial murders took place five years before .
NEG	unfortunately , `the skulls' is neither intriguing , nor suspenseful , nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting .
POS	yes , the movie would have been better--among his very best , i think--if it had a meatier story .
NEG	instead of norman bates we have two brothers - one of them traumatised physically , another mentally .
NEG	the story is painfully dull and mind-numbingly cliched ( hands up who * wouldn't * guess he-man and skeletor take their fight into the real world ) and is acted out by either incredibly untalented actors ( dolph lundgren as he-man for one ) or good actors ( james tolkan , meg foster ) given such awful characters and dialogue that they can't help but seem terrible .
NEG	brooke shields showed up in a funny little performance as a big-headed mogul who after a while became routine and old .

NEG	jay is supposed to try to get her to sleep with him , but stop short of the actual act .
POS	both films cover much of the same ground although the earlier movie does so from a westerner's point of view and features boxoffice draw brad pitt .
POS	titantic , writer and director james cameron's much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed $200 , 000 , 000 epic , arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises , whether the film is worth it ?
NEG	tv shows should do just that stay on tv , it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers .
NEG	the point is not that they can't act ( and , for the record , they really _can't_ ) but that their individual personas , which works as a gimmick over the span of a four-minute music video , are too thin to survive outside of the truncated , video bite mtv world .
NEG	a complicated plot can be successful , but the story needs to make sense when it's over .
NEG	but the film was done in by its inept script , the unappealing way the film was directed , and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud .
NEG	will this guy ever get a real role ?
NEG	a soothsayer says that thirteen warriors must answer the summons , twelve northmen and one outsider .
NEG	plus the movie's ending ( understandably the result of the studio wanting the end of the film to have a " hook " for a sequel ) renders the rest of the film pointless .

NEG	it's a sad state of affairs when the back box blurb is more exciting than the movie contained within it .
NEG	they had no spark , no energy amongst them , and even though a few of the action scenes in the movie were cool ( see the trailer and you'll know which ones i'm talking about ) , the overall picture was lame and the dialogue and mystical bull-crap just buried it even further .
NEG	the implausible plot has max asking his best friend , jay ( jason lee ) , to hit on sam as a test .
POS	insane ( but inspired ) musical about alferd packer , the first man ever tried for cannibalism in america .
NEG	however , when two of his underlings ( robert stanton and bodhi pine elfman ) publish a mercury-encrypted message in a puzzle magazine as a final test of its effectiveness , simon cracks the code .

POS	they are highlighted by one child's return to roberta's class ( coming after the great old hollywood scene where he explains be can't be around anymore because " my mom said . . . " ) and a glowing concert .
POS	what is perhaps most sensational about gods and monsters is brendan fraser's bravura performance ; up until seeing this film i intensely disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movies he is in ( blast from the past , for example ) .
NEG	in 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition " director's cut " of the film on home video , a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres .
NEG	certain things in our lives are inevitable .
NEG	at some points , they use the cliche of the talking villain , where the villain has the advantage , can shoot seagal , but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan , or saying a corny line , to which seagal says something hokey back , and has had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them , and does .
POS	but the pacing of the story moves from deliberate to downright sluggish and the payoff of the tale left me less than satisfied .
POS	but , the thing is , it isn't .
POS	everyone has their own life story , both past and present , and every time two or more interact , they become part of each others' story ( not necessarily an important or even significant part , but a part nevertheless ) .
NEG	but palmetto is played like a dark , serious , detective noir drama , and watching harry's bumbling confidence amounts to an irritating distraction .
NEG	i had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes ; generally , a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting , filthy interiors , and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie .
NEG	how do they fix that ?
NEG	the skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale ( designed , i'm sure , to mirror the actual skull & bones from the same college ) .
NEG	okay , okay .
POS	isn't quite the tagging that's going to sell a movie .
POS	review by david wilcock ? 1998
POS	the whole scene is hilarious and exceptionally well written and acted .
POS	lumet's greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back , and lets the camera soak up the action .
NEG	this is one of the worst big-screen film experiences i've had for a while .
NEG	i , for one , don't enjoy feeling like an outsider .
NEG	doubtfire -- director raja gosnell edited that film , and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom -- but there's just as strong a whiff of tootsie in the main character's attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to a woman .
NEG	however , he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere .
NEG	so i guess , even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons .
NEG	sony , the studio that released " gloria , " obviously does not have any faith in the film , and i don't blame them .
NEG	joel schumacher has directed the film with no flair .
POS	when they clash , it isn't cartoonish hatred being displayed , but genuine frustration with the fact that they are such good friends but just cannot manage to co-exist .
NEG	her character also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics of the script , and there is no sense of realism about the character .
NEG	let me put this way , if you like action - get something else , if you like strong women in movies - get something else , if you have do decide between this and " black cat " for your hong kong female action - don't get either .
NEG	it's everything that the avengers is not -- saucy , clever , engaging , and entertaining .
NEG	spoiled rich kid kelley morse ( chris klein ) receives a new mercedes for a graduation present .
POS	" stir of echoes " isn't a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination , but in the thick , atmospheric mood it conjures up , it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror-drama , and is not only effective on a technical level , but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling working-class family .
NEG	a character that could have been simply awful is merely groan-worthy .
POS	luke perry accomplishes the not-inconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer .
POS	you have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment .
POS	then there are the bond girls .
POS	even more to this movie's credit is the fact that it is a sequel to the 1997 sleeper/cult hit austin powers : international man of mystery .

NEG	it can be argued that maybe i wanted too much from this movie .
POS	the word spreads instantly through town .
NEG	jay has to be the comic .
POS	tarantino's talky style manages to hold your attention heavily , but there are more than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline .
NEG	for example , a gunman bursts into a garden with the two guns in his hands firing away .
POS	though clearly not for all tastes , this film is bold and daring .
POS	it's a formula , and like any formula , it gets tiresome .
NEG	anyway , as expected , all's well that ends well , for this watchable piece of fluff , that comes over on screen better than it does when relating its story-line .
NEG	fans of this movie ( if any exist ) should enjoy the dvd release .
NEG	television allows you to impose as much , or as little , meaning on a show as you want . &nbsp ;
NEG	but the film ultimately fails , mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overly-familiar action scenes .
NEG	disney's " air bud " tells a boy-and-his-dog story with a twist -- the pooch is quite an accomplished basketball player .
POS	but dennis hopper stole every scene he was in .
POS	of course , beloved is really her daugher materialized , though we aren't flat out told that until later on in the film .
POS	i liked these scenes best , because the political became personal .
POS	revenge .
NEG	no , we don't , and certainly not one of this low-caliber , which felt like a cut-and-paste job of spare parts from much better , but similar , films .
POS	however , the whole film screams of unoriginality , and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through .
POS	the story : court composer salieri ( f .
NEG	interwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a dork she truly was , and she appears to be heading down that road again .
POS	although he is perfectly happy liking the same sex , his mother is aghast .
NEG	but the greatest problem of all is plot , or to be precise , the lack of plot .
POS	it shows how colonel nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics .
POS	there's a scene where john has just arrived at his mother's house , and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito , and having explained to his mother about the " great experiment " , beatrice asks , " now explain to me again why you don't want to stay at a hotel . "
NEG	much to the horror of everyone standing within earshot .
POS	it's fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat , and perhaps the film's best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return , allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others , but by his own innate behaviour .
NEG	this is there strictly for the kids .
POS	i'll admit , when i trotted off to see this film , the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow .
POS	and then , thirty minutes into the film , _boom_ .
POS	chaos obviously ensues , and the dude eventually finds himself in hot water with cops , crooks and lebowski's ultra-eccentric artist daughter maude ( julianne moore ) .
NEG	not that cindy does that bad , it's just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindy's extraordinary acting skills , but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation .
POS	i guess i was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character , but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character .
POS	it's an involving , engrossing experience - and considering it's basically a two-hander , mainly set in one locale , it's a remarkable piece of cinema .
NEG	well , there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn't the easiest i am sure .
POS	as the terrorist attacks continue and the body count rises , the question of martial law is raised .
POS	yes , this ending made me crack a smile for a couple of minutes , but ultimately it left me feeling as if i'd been cheated .
NEG	kenny gets into trouble , when , while on a munchie run , feeds his snack foods to a diabetic police horse .
POS	i doubt this movie will be nearly as popular as fargo , but its off the wall moments make it so far the best of 1998 .
POS	it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo isn't given more time to develop , because the potential seemed to be there .
POS	see it if you want to wrestle with some of these issues yourself , see it if you want to see denzel and ethan strike up a palpable chemistry on-screen , and see it if you like holding on to your seat-handles real tight during a movie .
POS	of course .
POS	aside from a few minor , general flaws , " donnie brasco " manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development .

NEG	there is no great demand for another giant ape movie-make that ape movie , period .
NEG	" the siege " is constantly heavy-handed , not entertaining or insightful , and just goes to prove that not even the best actors can save a film that lacks a satisfactory screenplay .
POS	the plot is much more detailed than the aforementioned and this is what makes david lynch's story telling so amazing .
POS	it's a reminder of andreas and claire's past love ( as young lovers , they met by train ) , but as it recurs , we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed .
POS	instead , wang's film is populated by a group of refreshingly off-beat characters living in the ultimate cultural melting pot : new york city .
POS	in contrast , the son's room captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning ( denial , depression , anger , bargaining , acceptance ) through each of its main characters .
POS	this harshness is exactly what frank is , so weird and twisted that it is hard not to look at him , even if he theatens you to look away .
POS	the chemistry between the cast is remarkable .
NEG	something like the underground worm thriller `tremors' had just the perfect mixture of these elements , and in return , the film was tremendous fun .
NEG	also , where the hell did the budget go ?
POS	in a classic movie theme , the two parts of the ship , first class and steerage ( third-class ) exist in sharp contrast .

NEG	the actor , while usually downright charming , doesn't know exactly where to take his character - a fault that again can be blamed on the hapless writers .

NEG	the cast shows some early promise .
NEG	here in singapore , as our local movie critics like to whine , we seem to get the pick of the crop of " my explosion is more real-looking than yours " movies , but nothing else .
POS	in many ways , mr . niccol's screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca -- both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity , with pivotal , character-defining moments occurring at sea .
NEG	several other variations on this wordplay surface all throughout the film .
POS	beckinsale plays extreme bitch personified , yet her character never becomes completely unlikeable .
NEG	i am too young to have seen star wars in the theater during its original release , but that doesn't make me any less dedicated to it .
POS	at over two and a half hours in length it's a true epic , and if you're a fan of the genre you'll love f * * k-filled minute of it .
POS	it's about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values don't pertain ; and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment .
NEG	we get a lot of tough street talk -- usually mumbled for effect -- and a whole lot of the f-word , whether it sounds like it fits or not .
NEG	to make matters worse , schlondorff badly dubs in dialogue while the character's lips are running over each others bodies .
NEG	i will never , and you can hold me to this , i will never pay to see this man's movies , unless , and only unless , he's in a supporting role ( i . e .

POS	both have things the other wants and vice versa , but when they compromise , is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other .
NEG	yet , as douglas endures his personal gauntlet , we're given very few pieces of the puzzle to illuminate us on who this man really is .
NEG	a few parts the net , and a few parts conspiracy theory , enemy is about as exciting as watching smith talk to cgi aliens in 1997's lame brained men in black .

NEG	none of it is smart .
POS	since i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city , i cannot provide an answer as to why it didn't .
POS	but i finally saw it ( double feature with ready to wear i think ) and hated it .

POS	i don't box with kid gloves .
NEG	his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even " the wizard of oz , " a book which figures into the movie's plot .
NEG	the reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive with some frequency , notably with the hilarious use of the word " feminist " as an identifying caption for every single female character in the film .
NEG	writer-director victor mignatti's " very romantic comedy " ( as the ad campaign states ) is supposed to be ( pardon the pun ) a gay ol' romp , but it's hard to have much fun with these annoying , self-absorbed characters and their shallow personal problems : marc and cynthia have sitcom-level domestic " crises " ( such as trying to kill bugs--how hilarious ) ; robert and marc go to acting class ( how riveting ) ; the zaftig cynthia goes on eating binges ( how original ) .
NEG	capsule : combine one quart of raiders of the lost ark , a dash of a jackie chan movie ( sans jackie ) , two teaspoons of gun- and swordplay , and a dollop of cgi .

NEG	it's not that macdonald isn't a funny guy .
POS	the younger members of the cast fare less well .
NEG	the dialogue is cringe-inducing .

NEG	it will show once or twice , and then no one , thankfully , will ever have to hear from it again .
NEG	so , basically , this film is just a series of mastabatory images , sometimes featuring a non-nude alicia ( once again , sadly ) , sometimes featuring a scantily-clad george segal ( once again , sadly ) .
NEG	wahlberg does not have the physical or mental presence of a chuck heston to carry the film or any of its action sequences .

NEG	also , for a movie that's supposed to be about all of these exotic locations , i wasn't necessarily impressed by any of its exterior shots , and even less so with its interiors , which all looked like they were shot in the same room .
POS	we see this in the murdered archbishop , in the accused , and , most strongly , defense attorney martin vail .
POS	also , a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar ( effectively played by lolita davidovich ) , but abruptly dropped and never brought up again .

POS	sophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today .
NEG	for the ending !
POS	but the real treat comes with the circus bugs ; they're such a likable group of characters -- the standouts are the stick ( hyde-pierce is so good ) , francis the ladybug , and the big fat caterpillar .
NEG	they have resurrected yet another cartoon and turned it into a live action hodgepodge of expensive special effects , embarrassing writing and kid-friendly slapstick .

POS	finally , matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment : it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word .
NEG	the corruptor is an action movie , and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences .

NEG	it's not entertaining , and it's not even a good time passer .

POS	the coen brothers have assembled a great cast that play off each other perfectly .
POS	the reason for this act of destruction is revenge .
NEG	a silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place , as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover ; character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag .

NEG	critique : incoherent , boring , one-act drivel with no suspense , horribly unbelievable futuristic environment , bad dialogue , career-defining bad acting by keanu reeves and a hilarious ending .
NEG	one of such filmmakers was italian director tinto brass , who later made career shooting expensive , stylish soft porn .

POS	dane , who played a spock-like alien , is especially disgusted , considering himself above his demeaning job and stubbornly refusing to recite his character's cheesy trademark line " by grabthar's hammer , you shall be avenged " ( or something like that ) for his die-hard fans .
NEG	if anything , hammer always had his professionalism , but the movie does away with that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful .
POS	brooks had the right idea with her occupation , but she never pulled through .
POS	and in an awful lot of vegas shows , an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing .

NEG	however , that is , as they say , neither here nor there because kids will probably not like the movie anyway .
POS	driving miss daisy is a movie about human nature , aging , prejudice , and a great many other things , but more than anything it's about a relationship : one that spans 25 years , 4 cars , the advent of civil rights , and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon .

POS	bowfinger latches onto the idea immediately , and convinces his troupe of actor friends to appear in the film , based on the lie that america's top box office draw , kit ramsey ( murphy ) , has agreed to star .
POS	it's pretty obvious the film's makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time , but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving .
POS	screenwriters sitch , santo cilauro , tom gleisner , and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate , further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans .

POS	all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself .
NEG	the special effects ( by john dykstra ) and production design ( by barbara ling ) are the primary stars of this film .

POS	i wish i could find it in myself to work up more outrage over the callous way humans are dispatched in starship troopers , but it didn't work out that way .
POS	unfortunately , this film is a little too intense for viewers , even for me , and i can stand almost anything ( i recently viewed the 2 1/2 hour long epic " caligula , " the worst film i have ever seen in my life , and did it in a mere 2 sittings ) .
POS	lighting and filters are used to create a mood ( as in a surprisingly emotional moment - jessie's remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy ) the film contains a lot of in-side jokes ( such as the one about videogames ) , and entertaining parodies on " jurassic park " and " star wars " .

NEG	and this is why osmosis jones doesn't click .
POS	the six characters , as in " the breakfast club , " can be easily labeled as a stereotype , but as they are developed , they become far more complex : casey ( elijah wood ) , the much picked upon nerd ; stokely ( clea duvall ) , a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her ; zeke ( josh hartnett ) , a drug dealer who turns out to be a science whiz ; stan ( shawn hatosy ) , the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics ; delilah ( jordanna brewster ) , the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist ; and marybeth ( laura harris ) , the sweet 'n southern new girl in town .

POS	i liked both of them , but i didn't necessarily believe that redford would fall for such a cold fish , even if the countryside air thawed her slightly .
NEG	nothing works out as planned - it fails both to entertain and to enlighten .
NEG	the bottom line- avoid this movie at all costs .
NEG	there's a kind of desperation in the movie's approach to humor that reveals the film makers' uncertainty about how entertaining the material is ; the manic style betrays itself as a last-ditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed script .
POS	is this that first couple or the second couple ? "
NEG	the conductor character probably has the most lines of anyone , even jamie lee .

POS	perhaps it ? s the best of the both decades ; it had the darkness of the aliens films , as well as the visuals and compelling story of blade runner , but moved beyond , i think , because the themes behind it were much stronger .
NEG	the charge of dream with the fishes's protagonists being wholly unempathetic is a bit of an odd one coming from me ; i seem to have a predilection for films with unlikeable characters , and indeed , in many cases have i been in the minority , supporting films which have been condemned as interminable due to the difficult , audience-unfriendly nature of their characters .

NEG	director mike newell ( " four weddings and a funeral " ) must have read a different draft of this script because the one that's being acted out up there between newark , jfk , and la guardia doesn't have an ounce of subtlety , and newell has made some awfully good-and funny-movies before .

NEG	the orgy scenes ( and one infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner and aneeka dilorenzo ) are the result of reshoots by guccione himself , which are so obviously removed from everything else in this film that it only adds to the embrassment ( every five seconds or so , the film cuts to random nudity , as if it was afraid its audience would forget this film is rated " x " ) .

NEG	a fellow critic once stated his belief that a reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review .

POS	i'd imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators' testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general .
POS	i was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role : he has such searing optimism and energy ; he's clearly a man who admires shakespeare , and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character ( inability to turn away from women , attention deficit disorder ) , we sense a great deal of affection and care .

NEG	he continually looks as if he needs a shave and a shower .
POS	i really shouldn't say anything more about the ending as far as details go , but let me add that it seemed not only shallow and lazy but also inconsistent with the rest of the film and not very believable .

POS	this film is about a real struggle , and the victories and defeats are not simple .
POS	there's not much of a discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves , and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff ( ed harris ) with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience , thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film .

NEG	every forty minutes of this two-hour film begins with a new theme , virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act .
POS	upon its release , despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it , the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status .

NEG	by the way this review is going , you may think the reasoning for my hate for this film is due to not liking animated films- hence why i hate this movie , because the king and i is a disgrace to animation .
POS	and i think that " 12 angry men " , " witness for the prosecution " and " paths of glory " would have been better choices for the oscar for the best picture of 1957 .
POS	however , one voice-over also stands out as horribly miscast .
POS	the screenplay , by david klass , is adapted from the novel written by james patterson , and yet i don't quite see how this story could have worked in novel form .
NEG	one of his teachers is the kind-hearted sister terry ( rosie o'donnell ) , who wears a philly baseball hat and equates the jesus stories with baseball , making him the clean-up hitter , and in my opinion , if she wasn't a big tv star , would have a vocation as a parochial school teacher , she is that convincing .
NEG	this bit of lame physical humor is typical of disney's meet the deedles , a movie more to be endured that watched .

POS	his name is sean , and marcy finds him repugnant at first , so you can obviously tell where this is headed .
POS	and there are several other episodes , each one trumping the next in outrageousness .
POS	the fact that the entire orchestra begins to play it over and over soon after is an overdone reference that shows how little credit he gives the audience .
POS	he begins to blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions of his boss , bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) , doing whatever he feels like .
POS	even ben affleck , leading the troupe of actors , manages to make a favorable impression ; and judi dench lends some brief moments of screen time as queen elizabeth i . gwyneth paltrow is by far , however , the standout of the lot , creating a large percentage of the forementioned vibrance .
NEG	that's saying a lot , because mi the movie was already a cheap , thoughtless imitation of its tv originator of the '60s/'70s .
NEG	that's when a movie builds enough background into the characters on the screen , so that we could actually " get into " it and care about them .
POS	and , as a scene during the final credits shows , he even turns his punishment into a positive opportunity for change and betterment .

NEG	but it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film ; as it stands , it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand .

NEG	but the two of them have to deal with an angry mob boss ( played by andrew dice clay , for the very first time entertaining ) , a stubborn club owner and family problems ( the latter in foolish is a perfect example of roger ebert's " idiot plot , " if everyone here wasn't an idiot , there would be no problem )
POS	watching it is like trailing your fingertips in a stream on a cool spring day .
POS	watching duvall on-screen , it's not hard to imagine that he would have been a magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting .
POS	not unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of the sixth sense , you can peer into the character's soul through breen's sad eyes .
NEG	basically the worst thing about this film , the real reason i'm giving this such a low rating , is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we'd do .
NEG	of course , because of the lack of written description , those who have read spillane's books will have a strong personal notion of what hammer looks like , and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations ( spillane , who played the character himself in 1963's " the girl hunters , " is generally considered the best of the film hammers ) .
NEG	9 : its pathetic attempt at " improving " on a shakespeare classic .

NEG	typical for teenage films , it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor .
NEG	this movie is the scariest movie of all time ! ! ! ! ! " .
NEG	it's obvious that the film maker is trying to strike a certain tone .
NEG	sure , dreyfuss dressing up like a chief is really funny , and it allows for some entertaining scenes , but the heart of this material is deeply clueless as to the themes and thoughts that it provokes .

NEG	cinematographer lloyd ahern ( who also did the only noteworthy work on hill's 1995 flop wild bill ) creates some nifty sunburned vistas , but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter-productive narration .
POS	in the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness , straining to get the words out .
POS	this time , it's an extended sequence that finds an african-american couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a sneak preview of " stab , " making sly references about everything from sandra bullock to the lunchmeat non-roles of blacks in slasher cinema .
POS	but the flick's not perfect .
POS	aristocracy proves a glass house , one that can barely withstand the upheaval of stones .

NEG	director cannon ( judge dredd ) is a competent filmmaker but not a particularly imaginative one-if there is a part three ( what on earth would they call it ? ) , and the fun denouement suggests there will be , here's my suggestion : hire a filmmaker with flair , someone who can really energize this stillborn series-someone who won't rely on so many shock notes .
NEG	the plot revolves about flintstones , family set in fictious stone age " town " of bedrock , whose members enjoy the lifestyle of 1950s middle class america .
POS	at 144 minutes , this film moves along fairly quickly .
NEG	the fact is , melvin is so desperate to keep people from not liking him , that he puts up with both an obnoxious fiancee ( christina applegate , with a horrendous new york accent ) and an abusive girlfriend ( lela rochon ) who is only using him for his money .
POS	the third would-be thief , unarmed , is only wounded .
POS	but there are many big laughs in the film , as i said , if you are in the right mood .
POS	two reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre : the first is that movie audiences have become more sophisticated , no , make that cynical and jaded .
POS	the premise is strong enough to sustain interest , but it's enough to throw a nod in the general direction of rod serling for wrapping up his ideas in half-hour time slots , commercials included .
POS	suffice to say , the film does , indeed , turn into a slasher film , albeit one that is more thoughtful than most , and replaces a knife-wielding maniac for the never-seen granddaddy killer of them all , the grim reaper itself .
POS	but obviously these small flaws didn't taint my overall enjoyment of this tense drama , a film that gets you right into the streets , into the nooks and the crannies , and into the moral dilemma which lies between the justice system and the day-to-day drug busts .
NEG	it's thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good - he gives the wry , derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy .
NEG	mr . schumacher's focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible , to the detriment of the story - there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between all-out camp and heartfelt drama , with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective .

NEG	that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves .
POS	the spy who shagged me has much of the same stuff we saw in the original , but that's okay by me because the original left us wanting more .
NEG	paul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the subway to an elderly woman ; his roommates adam ( zak orth ) , chris ( tom sadoski ) and noah ( jimmi simpson ) are the kind of guys who blast their music and let their waterbeds leak all over paul .
POS	it's a wonderful performance in a role custom-tailored for him ; mr . toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr . downey jr . was arrested on drug charges , and it's hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character -- in a monologue to his mirrored reflection , blake's self-chiding to " get [his] shit together " is disquieting in its resonance .
POS	despite those minor complaints , gone in sixty seconds is pure summer movie entertainment .
NEG	it was written by david e . kelly ( " ally mcbeal " ) as a horror-comedy but fails at both , miserably .
POS	fire flies from the sky , flesh-eating beetles crawl about , and , well , ihmoetep's plan begins to unfold .

NEG	" doesn't it offend you that some girl offed herself yesterday , " asks one of the few kids with a conscience .
NEG	for some reason , they kill off luke at the end of the film .
POS	like the previous films of rigormortis that i have reviewed , it displays an off-kilter humor and intelligence ? it succeeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail .
POS	however , as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered .
NEG	to what end ? " --

POS	and in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear , will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa .
NEG	with " hanging up , " the only thing she needs to do is completely sever her filmmaking ties with nora ephron , a writer/director/hack who shouldn't be allowed to work in hollywood again after this big-budget , high-profile debacle .
POS	while it does remind one of danny boyle's shallow grave without the abundance of black humour , it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality , or the lack thereof , found in a film with this subject matter .
POS	when i saw the trailer for this film , i laughed harder than i had in quite some time .
NEG	the only actor in the movie with any demonstrable talent is a cute little prairie dog named petey .
NEG	this conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture .
NEG	unfortunately , problems with this film start with inadequate casting - rick moranis is too thin for the role of barney , while the cartoon betty used to be much skinnier than rosie o'donnell .
NEG	it's all too easy to pick out everything wrong with " money talks . "
NEG	do you think you know where this is headed ?

NEG	the theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster , however .

NEG	christopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft , a scientist who not only wants to steal phillip's ideas , but his woman too .
NEG	he's not a warrior , and at first not well accepted by the vikings , but as the movie advances he'll have to prove himself both on and off the battlefield .
NEG	but it's clear how weak this premise is from the get-go and the film just gets worse .
NEG	the occasional despair that his script requires him to exhibit is excruciatingly forced , as are his warm and fuzzy scenes with his little bro .
NEG	to the rescue -- lesra martin ( vicellous reon shannon ) and his team of wanna-be detectives .
NEG	novalee then decides to secretly hole up in the wal-mart ( because she's not the brightest bulb in the stagelights ) .
NEG	but wait !
NEG	perry and farley have no chemistry ; the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade , for it's his type of humor , and not at all what perry is associated with .
NEG	i will say that this movie looks as if it was made for about a hundred bucks , and that includes the actors' salaries .
NEG	just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story , here comes a double-exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever .

POS	can george lucas succeed yet again with transporting us back a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away . . . . ?
POS	rush is absolutely incredible as javert ; i don't remember ever feeling so strongly about a villain as i do here ; he adds depth and complexity with subtle glances and nuances , and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense .

NEG	not content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero , he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos' language and technology .
NEG	this is not entirely a bad thing , of course .
POS	even people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set .
POS	like any war film , glory has its share of gloom and despair , but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson , a valuable reminder that despite what the history books say ( or , more precisely , what they do not say ) , blacks played a critically important role in the north's victory over the south--forever changing the evolution of america .
POS	this eventually sparks a racial war between the " coloreds " and the " black & whites . "

NEG	jackson replies , " he had a spare . "
POS	overall , pleasantville is a very pleasant and provocative departure from the predictability of most films these days .
NEG	every scene which has any potential for dramatic impact is effectively diffused by either a stupid joke ( in a scene where tension escalates between the two brothers , foolish blurts out towards his jewelry-sporting sibling " you lay one hand on me and this cemetary is going to be a gold rush " ) or something even more idiotic such as foolish smashing his own car ( to which i said , a bit too loudly for the occasion " huh ?

NEG	unfortunately , anaconda was about as suspenseful and exciting as watching paint peel .
POS	and somehow , himself and the directors still manage to get all the drama and intensity of the story across , without ever being boring .
NEG	and to top it all off , the " twist " ending makes very little to no sense whatsoever , and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time .
NEG	and it's not just that it's disgusting or vile or whatever adjective you want to use to describe this film - it's that in a film where the entire feel it's going for isn't felt , it's also the sloppiest expensive movie of all time .
POS	my only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act , or at least any real sense of closure .

NEG	as a matter of fact , i found the activity incredibly boring , a complete waste of more than two hours .
POS	michael keaton makes his presence felt , albeit in small but dignified moments , and de niro is ideal in playing the lug-head who goes over the edge .
POS	it's also very emotional , thanks to a great script by david koepp , and amazing performances by pacino and miller .
POS	all involved do credible work in their respective roles , most especially mr . duncan , who turns in an impressive , fully realized characterization .
POS	one of these toys is wheezy , a penguin with a broken squeaker .
POS	even though it doesn't have all of the ingredients of a true disney film , this film is a classic in its own right , and deserves a far better chance than what it has been given .
NEG	younger viewers will likely be taken in by the abounding goofiness , but their adult companions may feel a wave of nausea sweeping over them as they attempt to endure this appalling 80-minute exercise in glaring stupidity .
NEG	this just sounds too bad to be true , the least that could have been done was keep semi close to the original movie to give this film a chance .

POS	i hate to do this , but last year's film " the game " got it damn perfect : it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human being , a man who is cold and has cut off everyone from his life , and then pulls everything he thought he had as a security blanket away from him and watched what happened .
NEG	as it is , it's somewhat tolerable , but not very entertaining .
NEG	action movies don't have to be realistic , but they should absorb you enough so that you're not thinking about the lack of realism .

POS	at that convenient moment , the coast guard shows up and libby is arrested .
NEG	sometimes a stellar cast can compensate for a lot of things , and " pushing tin " certainly features some name stars who are going places : billy bob thornton , cate blanchett , angelina jolie , and oh yes john cusack who might not realize it at first , but he's actually the * veteran * among this quartet of fine-looking people .
NEG	this is a dreadful motion picture ? a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughs-to-jokes ratio .

NEG	apparently , the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultra-secret code called " mercury . "
POS	few filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial , technical , and creative responsibility single-handedly , and it's testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall .

NEG	the adult characters probably fare the worse of any , since they all must play residents of a dim-witted town that cares about nothing but football .
NEG	the movie started off in the hands of john mctiernan ( you'll notice a lot of similarities between " warrior " and mctiernan's " predator , " including the chittering jungle sounds ) .
NEG	one wonders what exactly she originally had in mind for this jumbled film , a comedy-drama that appears doomed at its most basic elements .
NEG	of course , she will get her revenge in the obligatory ending bloodbath in which she will decapitate and castrate the boys and crush the girls with burning timbers .
POS	in addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast -- mr . emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness -- the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating truman's antiseptic , white picket-fenced smalltown utopia , and by burkhard dallwitz's original score .
POS	and so the film begins to take shape , first by following ronna and her friends on a one-night adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam ( who were actually looking for simon ) , which doesn't exactly go as planned , but that's what keeps it all so interesting .

POS	in a commanding performance , mr . carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes him a genuinely engaging presence , and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn , demonstrating admirable restraint -- there's an early scene where he's down on his knees gardening , and given his past track record , one almost instinctively anticipates mr . carrey to pull one of more infamous , and in this case , wholly inappropriate sight gags .
NEG	the only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard .

NEG	even though there is still action going on .
POS	to further emphasize this , redford and cinematographer robert richardson ( " natural born killers , " " platoon " ) cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film - which takes place in new york - with mostly cold , harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1 . 85 : 1 aspect ratio ; when the action shifts to montana , richardson switches to soft-focus and natural lighting , and the screen widens to a 2 . 35 : 1 aspect ratio .

NEG	" it was not scary . "
POS	while i do not consider myself the " happy endings are automatically stupid " type , i thought that " shallow grave " really should have ended in tragedy - a realistic analysis of the story up to the last ten minutes of the film would indicate that all three characters were probably about to end up in prison , in the mental hospital , or in the morgue .

NEG	one of the best examples that hollywood now completely ignore these qualities is found in the new film where the heart is .
NEG	when you think about it , this film is not really meditating on the question " when is a robot no longer a machine , but a human being ? " , but tells a story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding .

POS	i don't know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn't have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film , and which never resurfaces after the movie's beginning , but there it is .
NEG	however , throughout this simple plot , we've got to suffer outlandish special effects , poor comedy , and an very , very mean performance from bill murray .
POS	these types of characters might not sound all that original , but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father , a mid-level drug dealer , a narc obsessed with multi-level-marketing , horny wedding guests , a zen lovemaker , two shrimp-scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out .

POS	if you look at the quality of those films , you'll hear what i'm saying .

NEG	every time chase and quaid were involved in a gag , it just made it more and more apparent that they should have stopped this series after the third film .
POS	despite showcasing ali's proud unequivocal politics , one of the most impressive features of " when we were kings " is the subtle way in which the documentary considers the difficulties inherent in the overarching philosophy of black unity and black symbolism that ali and his supporters champion .

NEG	if caught , they risk losing all the money , and their love .
NEG	jim is sort of a jerk even before he becomes a junkie , but i suppose that his pseudo-sensitive poetry and his devotion to his terminally ill friend are intended to balance that out .
POS	his george is a bit of a devilish rogue , entirely affable , and mr . everett's performance is a delight to watch ; he's clearly having fun , and his joy is infectuous .

POS	the movie is good enough to see in the theaters , but it may work even better on television , the very medium at which it pokes fun .

POS	i also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old , parody and actual reinvention ( note theron's entire female persona that is drenched in film noir- very cool ) .
POS	this film is bad .

POS	there is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color .
POS	liam neeson is terrific in the main role ; neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well , and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits that adjective .

NEG	i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor - such as it was .
NEG	arnold is , of course , one of the parents , a crack salesman who is never there for his son .

NEG	four of the biggest directors in hollywood : quentin tarantino , robert rodriguez , alexander rockwell , and alison anders were all directing one big film with a big and popular cast .
POS	certainly the characterizations of the judge and spacey's lawyer both help immensely , as does having the fly-guy as the jury's foreman .

NEG	to make matters worse , he does not know the people on his own side , tony and his backers , he can trust .
NEG	but tucker , at least for me , is a pretty funny guy , and aces the movie's best scene , where franklin passes himself off as vic damone's son at james and grace's engagement bash and toasts the couple with barry white lyrics .
POS	some scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected and/or obvious ( the dream sequences were extraneous ) , but the majority of the film is subdued-and singer's handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murderer-in-training .

NEG	accomplished actors like craig t . nelson ( as skulls chairman judge litten mandrake ) and william peterson ( as fellow board member senator levritt ) are dealt pathetic villain caricatures , and look suitably embarrassed handling them .
NEG	there seem to be more cheap references than frenzied send-ups here , so it's possible that director/writer pat proft , by bombarding the viewer with a careless mixture of the two , guarantees something is sure to stick .

NEG	that was a pity because his character was one of the few reasons my friend and i didn't give up and fall asleep .

NEG	to understand spiceworld , you have to understand the spice girls .

POS	we skip two years , but there doesn't seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks .
POS	perhaps one of the best things about this film , is its naturalness .
POS	but there are also many , many delights for adults , including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matilda's classmates recite in sing-song fashion ; there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matilda's father .
POS	it's human and , while the script takes some artistic licence , the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic .
NEG	will the movie actually explain some things ?

NEG	it boasts extremely glossy cinematography , a couple of recognizable name actors , and a couple of fairly impressive explosions .
POS	with this and " crimson tide , " he's created two successfully chilly films that are interesting , exciting , even pretty smart , but never totally riveting as cinema , and the problem i think with each of these films is that each film is too obsessed with its message to ever be really satisfying , and too obsessed with looking all cutting edge to ever be totally smart .
NEG	it gets so formulaic that it's possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a " boo " will come .

NEG	the vr sequences are way cool , but the physical fx--such as miniatures and mattes--leave a lot to be desired .

POS	spacey doesn't appear until the final 30 minutes and also doesn't receive billing in the opening credits .
POS	likewise , while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan , they are never anything more than " abolitionists . "
NEG	i'm also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st . thomas is so earth-shattering .
POS	after grimacing through the forced screwball antics of movies like america's sweethearts and the princess dairies , it's an almost indescribable pleasure to see a director taking his time to tell a story very well .

NEG	by the end of the film , all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on , but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed .
POS	registering not as strongly--but through no fault of their own--are vanessa williams ( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez ) and a dismayingly underused roundtree ; they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price , singleton , and shane salerno .
NEG	hammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jack's death , and with the help of his devoted secretary , the blond and shapely velda ( laurene landon ) , and the alternately friendly / antagonistic police chief pat chambers ( paul sorvino ) , he is immediately on the killer's trail .
NEG	well , maybe a-quarter ( of a star ) for the originality of the co-sex shower scene and the ( very ) brief moments of suspense , another quarter for copying `zulu' and letting the good guys ( the bugs ) win , and half a star for the sucking-out of the brain of one of those people who call themselves actors ( but there should have been more , the troopers deserved to die ) .

NEG	suddenly , i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before , i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in .
POS	but like it or not , along comes " scream 2 . " and believe it or not , it's a doozy -- a slick , sinister , madly subversive good time at the movies , as intent on sending up hollywood's sequel syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher conventions .
NEG	not only are the characters needlessly complex , but the once-simple plot becomes so convoluted that the actual theft of christmas seems like an afterthought .
POS	what's also charming about " i went down " is how the relationship between buddy and git develops .

NEG	for the most part , however , they're just actors spouting lines .

POS	her relationship with vail is believable ; their verbal fencing adds to the film .
NEG	but the guy makes worse films than reagan did .
NEG	a large part of hurlyburly's success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood ; that there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world , toys , playthings .
NEG	either way fright night part 2 would most likely not enter into the equation .
POS	when gugino goes back home for thanksgiving , she brings shore with her , and her parents ( lane smith and cindy pickett ) are less than thrilled .
NEG	the only thing that distinguishes species 2 is how awful it is .
POS	it is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments , but it is a little thin , and the structuring of the " on-again-off-again " friendship at the film's center is fairly predictable .

NEG	i longed for the magnetic presence of han , luke , and leia , but i got no such thing .

POS	let's face it : since waterworld floated by , the summer movie season has grown * very * stale .
POS	certain scenes work well , but not nearly as well as they worked in the original .
POS	firstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without hardly any supporting characters , ( a few have a line or two ) , mostly extras .
POS	what is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year .
NEG	a film which showed roman decadence as something that was perhaps liberating for some but could not last - that would probably make for a good film .

POS	( jackson also has little to " do " in a sense ; some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside , his shaft doesn't even have one sex scene . )
NEG	some stuff happens in the middle of the movie , but i can't remember most of it , because i often found a twitching hair in the corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on screen .

NEG	everything in the phantom you have seen many times before and there is nothing new presented here .

POS	one might wish he hadn't picked the profession of analyst for the father , giovanni ( which he stars as ) , if only because this makes his character's reactions so predictable .
NEG	the extraterrestrials breed and gestate like those from the alien series , and their craft looks like a leftover set piece from independence day .

NEG	rusty becomes a vegas high roller , providing most of the film's best moments .
NEG	maybe the scene was intended for laughs , but it only cheapens hammer's character and is , by all accounts , a lousy way to start the movie .

NEG	i'm never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people -- several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing -- but i know that when a film-maker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that it's an entire film , i duck out of the way .
NEG	the first two words should have said enough to let you know what occurs during bean's trip to la , but if they didn't look out because you are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride .

NEG	there are times when gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen .
POS	stylishly filmed and tautly directed by " x-files " alum james wong , the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters ( in accurately written " teen-speak , " rather than overwrought , highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldn't use ) , all the while developing into a darkly foreboding , severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the less-successful , but still suspenseful epilogue .

NEG	unfortunately , no one involved appears to have the faintest idea how to deal with the comic gold mine involved in one real person pretending to be another , very different real person , so they fall back on an endless parade of sight gags : malcolm reacting violently to big momma's explosive diarrhea attack ; malcolm-as-momma schooling a pair of cocky teens in basketball ; malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments ; malcolm delivering a baby because big momma is the town midwife ( one of the few sequences that works ) .

POS	three to tango's script , written by rodney patrick vaccaro and aline brosh mckenna is fun , fast , and funny , delivering not only original , hilarious gay jokes ( not your run of the mill material ) , but a certain snappiness in the dialogue between characters that always keeps you smiling .

NEG	the duo * look * the part -- and admittedly the avengers is , more than most , heavily dependent upon style -- but they're no fun to watch , and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture's caper-esque plot .

NEG	there is no writer to speak of ( what the hell does it mean that it's " adapted from an original screenplay by gore vidal ? " ) , but nevertheless , the dialogue is shit , so laughably bad that i can't in good faith believe that anyone with an iq over 5 could say them with a straight face ( my favorite being the line when caligula inquires the doctor about the health of the dying tiberius : " he could go at any moment , but with care , he could last a year or so .

POS	this isn't the sort of role one usually associates with ms . roberts - the julianne character's neurotic , fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role - but ms . roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here , remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience , if not entirely sympathetic , even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable .

POS	my best friend's wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film , and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect - it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen's everyone says i love you ; i'd even assert it's a more successful one .

NEG	porter tries to get control of his life before it is too late , but like a man fighting against quicksand , his struggle just sinks him deeper .
POS	that's fantastic , especially when considering of all the classic characters and scenes the film has served up -- who can forget aspiring beautician frenchie ( didi conn ) being serenaded by her tell-it-like-it-is guardian angel ( frankie avalon ) ?
POS	and , thankfully , every bit of that personal investment translates on-screen into power and honest emotion .
NEG	witness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or the constant pseudo-saintliness of our four protagonists .
POS	another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air .

NEG	as if afraid to let the viewer find their own ( perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear ) emotional foothold in the material , spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had : the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary ( reminscent of the closing scene from _schindler's list ) , the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close ( every bit as bad as schindler's monologue about how his car , tiepin or ring could have saved another jew ) , quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson , captain miller's last words to private ryan , and an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain .
POS	besides being romantic and dramatic , the script includes liberal doses of humor .
NEG	their starring roles and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen before--sometimes just minutes before .

NEG	as i write this , i also wonder how many people have actually seen the movies on which this spoof is based .
POS	the effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking .

POS	" beloved " is challenging to watch , filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard , and instead of a straight-forward , hollywood-ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed , " beloved " comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened ( or , rather , toni morrison , who wrote the novel upon which this is based ) .
