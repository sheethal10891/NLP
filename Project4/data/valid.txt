NEG	on the mediocre side are actually those playing the two central characters : matthew perry and bruce willis .
POS	pitt puts a credible spin on his character and does some incredible physical stuff , too , as a bare-knuckle boxer .

NEG	it's too bad that the core of the film isn't much better , since it is comprised of sometimes funny , but forgettable dialog .

NEG	a romantic interest .
POS	it bears some resemblance , story-wise , to the coens' recent " fargo , " but even the darkly satirical humor and the enjoyably quirky characterizations that characterized that film are scarce here ; " blood simple " is pretty much cold and brutal from beginning to end .

NEG	the only notable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look .
POS	first , there is a major flaw in the story towards the end that is somewhat distracting ( email me if you have seen the movie and want to know what i think it is ) .
NEG	have a much better time .
POS	i was worried that disney was going to make another hercules ( sorry , jerk-ules ) .
POS	- it does not get dark .
NEG	i have learned to expect little from films like metro , and consequently i am bored by them more often than i am genuinely disappointed .
POS	robocop 3 starring nancy allen and robert john burke
POS	the film is comprised of home video and 16mm camera footage that the documentarians supposedly shot for their blair witch film , so don't expect any steadi-cam shots or fancy camera work .
NEG	but it's not a complete disaster .
POS	the cinematography and setting of their island are simply wonderful .
NEG	o jason patric's character walks onto the bridge and immediately understands everything that's happening
NEG	while this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship and reflect with poignancy on the past , the script by sisters delia and nora ephron is exasperating , shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery .
POS	thankfully , ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey , kinnear , chappelle , and a host of others , including a great scene involving brothers , aunts , and two sweet kids .
NEG	when they get close to kissing , i was asking myself , " why do they want to kiss ?
NEG	coming off of her oscar-caliber work in two of last year's best films , " clockwatchers " and " the opposite of sex , " lisa kudrow's throwaway " girlfriend " role is an incredible step down .
POS	more importantly , it takes us right up the brink of emotion , then jumps right over it .
POS	instead , it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants .
POS	the script , by favreau , is great .
NEG	i guess i'm one of the few critics who actually kind of liked the original film ( emphasis on the " kind of " ) .
NEG	some of these excursions were fun .
NEG	the characters are paper-thin and the interesting ideas purely non-existent .
NEG	you get an audience in a coma .
NEG	who does he think he is ?
POS	i doubt he ever expressed any genuine feeling at all during the film .
POS	in my reviews i try to make gentle recommendations rather than telling you what to see or what not to see .
POS	i still know what you did last summer is nothing compared to the first film .
NEG	sometimes i even find myself up at 4am watching re-runs of my favorite episodes , trying to recapture some of that sense of wonder i felt as a kid .
POS	now in theatrical release in the united states , it eschews the seriousness of most art house films with a romping good story .
POS	this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal .
POS	my ability to entertain somehow convinces my son that living in a concentration camp is somewhat beautiful ?
NEG	america's foreign policies ?
POS	he plays truman burbank , the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in the world .
POS	the film's raison d'etre are the scenes of crimes against mankind -- the most famous monuments of the world crumble under the alien assault , easter island is turned into a bowling alley , and the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans .
POS	exley , squeaky clean , innocent , and pent with the desire to perform his new duties with integrity and honesty quickly answers with a pointed 'no . '
POS	" existenz " does not .
NEG	wh : thanks for the advice .
POS	the movie smartly portrays these men as loathsome rednecks , and , of all things in the world , it is becoming rather easy to root for villains ( jon voight in anaconda ) in today's movies .
NEG	starting with a burglary of francis's flat , the film uses loud sound effects that sound like they were lifted from a cheap horror movie .
POS	i loved it .
NEG	sure , it had the big battle scene at the end , but the only excitement felt was that the movie might be nearing a conclusion .
NEG	essentially , this premise is a clever-way to make a slasher-flick without the slasher .
POS	it's a worthy effort , with terrific acting and some impressive writing from elmore leonard and tarantino .
NEG	that about accounts for the three or four chuckles you will expel during the film .
NEG	all due respect .
NEG	in this particular case , attractive and pleasant exhibit a is jimmy shannon ( chris o'donnell ) , a single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage .
POS	ellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to a dream-like place that looks a lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels , where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father ( david morse ) .
POS	just remember not to think .
POS	the myserious stranger begins his tale , or more precisely his confession , in geneva , 1773 .
POS	it matters not that they actually have a laughable master plan in mind ( ask yourself if a species like this seems capable of carrying out such a plot ) ; these sequences of insect warfare are numerous , bloody and immensely satisfying .
NEG	i admit it .
NEG	that's not likely to happen , though , so " 8mm " is indeed a scummy waste of money .
POS	this little film was called 'clerks' and this little film went on to become a huge video sensation .
NEG	the characters are mostly lifeless , played to type , but not much more .
NEG	they're so adorable .
NEG	the original cartoon still works , so what's the point ? "
NEG	if allen were giving the audience a story that was worth decoding , any and all of these stylistic touches could be excusable .
POS	the acting , from most around is great .
NEG	by the way , do you know how the investigation takes place ?
NEG	i think someone in the audience put it best when , after the movie had ended with another " the killer is back ! "
NEG	and from there , once the yearning has been established and the romantic denouement must occur , it's all downhill .
NEG	doubtfire meets dumb & dumber , and that's not a concoction anyone should be overly anxious to try .
NEG	joe goes on a date with meg ryan , his co-worker .
POS	the strength of this film is it's gritty realism .
NEG	but far more entertaining . . .
POS	the logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and to make smith's points , and in itself , has little dramatic momentum .
POS	kurt russell and kathleen quinlan respectively play jeff and amy taylor , a massachusetts couple en route to california for a brand new job .
POS	jackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino , whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction .
NEG	finally , molly shannon ( rising film star and cast member on " saturday night live " ) has a rousingly hilarious one-scene cameo right at the beginning as one of crystal's patients and then completely disappears .
NEG	coach ( brian dennehy , just loving the fact that he's got some work on the big screen ) is on hand to give the curmudgeonly counterpoint .
NEG	the man who cried has many aspirations , none of which come full circle by the film's close .
NEG	though the movie skimps on the next few plot points , here's what i could determine : said assassin then becomes the leader of satan's army , under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown ( leguizamo , grating as always ) .
NEG	in fact watching films like that after having watched " scary movie " is impossible keeping a serious face .
POS	this is pretty much just one trashy film .
NEG	instead , stuart places his trust in a " name " star who can't carry the material .
NEG	there's orson welles ( angus macfadyen ) who of course is the director of the play , the producer john houseman ( cary elwes ) , marc blitzstein ( hank azaria ) the writer of the play , emily watson , a woman who gets her break by playing the main part in cradle will rock .
POS	however , the main flaw of the film is there's too much of everything , and not enough of it either .
NEG	but hey , i'll admit it ; the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked .
POS	if movies really had guts nowadays , i would have loved to have seen this movie come down to a final choice for garcia's character .
NEG	they have stories where the so-called hero just keeps running into characters who have some connection to one of the other characters who are all antagonists without a reason for being in the movie other than to give the protagonist someone to fight , chase or shoot at .
POS	i found it quite intriguing and delightful and went back 3 more times in the period it endured at the box office .
POS	the director , john mcnaughton , took a small budget and a gallery of actor friends and created a chilling and intelligent piece of work .
POS	let's face it : the $100 million-plus smash that was " goldeneye " was not a good film by any means , and as a bond movie was only marginally better than , say , " a view to a kill " or either of the timothy dalton pictures , by virtue of nice pacing .
NEG	he demands that the robbers be caught and punished immediately , leaving the job in the hands of the devious chance ( ken stott ) who has a few more things on his mind than catching criminals .
POS	these youth know they are going through a phase , and are simply enjoying it .
POS	that is except a small band who have discovered this horrible secret and have escaped their virtual prisons .
POS	here , however , she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead .
POS	now for those of you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart .
POS	it obsesses itself with the depth and the style of it all , and makes the story of a world-reknowned cellist who contracts ms and dies prematurely into the story of two sisters , both musicians , who have a totally unique relationship .
POS	he does do a good job towards the end , but that doesn't clear up the scars he already left on the film .
NEG	first up is the plot , which there really isn't much of , in fact the plot what there is : a bad guy trying to destroy the ancient never before seen pokemon , lugia , is about it , except the fact that ash kethcum the worlds best pokemon trainer must try and stop him before he destroys this one pokemon forever .
NEG	however , as fate would have it , an accidental meeting with `what-ever-happened-to' richard grieco gives them the all-important ticket to get in .
POS	kevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie .
POS	one viewing will not be enough to understand fully the premise of pulse .
POS	none seem very affected by their experiences , and few even show any passion at all .
POS	the others would find the author's element within the story - star wars could be seen as an anti- establishment film ; young , long-haired , easy going , nature-loving heroes are fighting against old , uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes .
POS	in boogie nights and ed wood , the aspirations of the respective filmmakers' prove to be bemusing , not in their intentions -- there's nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an 'artistic' erotic picture -- but in the degree that they miss the mark .
NEG	trust me when i say that it's a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through .
NEG	the iffiness in judge's plot -- a group of coworkers plan the downfall of their despicable boss -- is not in its appeal .
NEG	but i have to wonder ( and in this movie , you have a very long time to wonder ) how you or i would act in a similar situation , especially if you or i were a multimillionaire .
POS	what better message is there for christmas ?
POS	in short , i like this guy , and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories .
NEG	when she delves into martha's dark side , predictable cliches -- chain-smoking , staring in mirrors , praying in a confessional to a priest who isn't there , poking a hole in helen's diaphragm so she'll become pregnant ( and she does ) -- abound , but it's moderately entertaining junk because lange is such an interesting actress to watch .
NEG	on the good side , charlize theron is darn cute , and the movie is no longer then 90 minutes .
NEG	well there you go , of course ash is followed by his friends misty , brock , gary and his pokemon friends , pikachu , squirtle , charizard , the usual .
NEG	in fact , even bigger names like mohr , wolf , and katie holmes don't have enough time to make substantial success .
NEG	he's a doctor and she's an unemployed art gallery director and they share a central park west address .
NEG	written by david j . schow and john shirley , based on the comic book series and comic book strip by james o'barr .
NEG	however , it is also hard to compliment it .
POS	since i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters , and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective , i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained .
NEG	( to add some colour , johnny also happens to be toting their father's corpse , sans one hand . )
POS	instead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york , schlesinger sets up this final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at joe .
POS	here , the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , who's accompanying a hapless professor ( nigel hawthorne ) on an expedition through the jungle .
POS	sure , the whole second marriage was his mother's idea , but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children , then he could have still easily backed out , couldn't he ?
NEG	the film's only saving graces are a few well-executed suspense sequences and a really cool cameo by the " re-animator himself , jeffrey combs .
POS	more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way .
POS	it is very obvious that these actors have been working together for over a decade .
POS	jonathan harker is a young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with a creepy count ( played by klaus kinski ) who wants to buy a house in harker's hometown .
NEG	i imagine the writers presume their core audience for double jeopardy is a very naive group of individuals .
POS	their sex scenes together are bracing in their raw honesty , in the acceptance of flesh and messiness .
POS	before entering the cinema , i was initially a little bit nervous about what this film would be like .
NEG	now it's up to ash and his friends to stop this pokemon entei and show him to be a good pokemon rather than a bad one .
POS	despite the catchiness of the songs , this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadn't have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show .
POS	the men in black ( mib ) are the watchdogs that oversee the cosmic citizens , guardians of our beloved planet from nasty-tempered aliens , and secret service to the stars .
POS	it would at most receive a pg rating .
POS	the iceberg arrives , and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour .
NEG	well arnold has completed the seemingly impossible task .
POS	and concerning the plot developments , the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before .
NEG	( evelyn c . leeper ) approved : ecl@mtcts1 . att . com
NEG	for all the blood and gore , nudity , and sex thrown in , species ii is , quite simply , a vapid bore .
NEG	the finale with the heston/gardner/bujold love triangle is ended in a basic flip-of-the-coin bit , which brings out a big let-down .
POS	what would i do ?
NEG	instead , it's all rather boring .
POS	what is a sham ?
NEG	as the fighter's head is sliced open with a heavy blow , the camera cuts to a gleeful francis whose own head is soaked by the flying blood .
POS	for some reason , blade spends a lot more time using his kung fu artistry than using the traditional anti-vampire weapons of garlic and silver .
NEG	dialogue , unfortunately , just isn't enough to make a quality script .
POS	his directing style can be best described as transparent -- it never gets in the way of the story , yet it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions .
POS	but this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do .
POS	the love scenes between the women are especially beautiful .
POS	- excerpt from twister production notes
NEG	william katt and p . j . soles ( students in carrie ) are liz's distraught parents , jeff conaway ( from grease ( 1978 ) ) is julie's creepy single dad and carol kane ( the frightened babysitter in when a stranger calls ( 1979 ) ) camps it up as principal miss sherman .
POS	the voices are all clear , the music pours out on you and engulfs you in richness .
POS	and a cautionary tale for the strict and prudish : as a teen , ms . graham's parents forbade her to take a part in the twisted cult classic heathers ; since then , her most notable roles have been as a junkie ( gus van sant's drugstore cowboy ) and now a porn starlet .
POS	minutes later , in her flat , she walks in on her lover , gerry ( john lynch ) , in bed with another woman ( jeanne tripplehorn ) .
NEG	well , the quartet of chums - jim ( jason biggs ) , oz ( chris klein ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) - have grown up .
POS	it stands as a moment one will not soon forget : a giant , green ogre flips through the pages of a cliche fairy tale , narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds .
NEG	jeff goldblum disappoints .
NEG	no problem .
POS	he's been head bartender at a posh restaurant for over six years .
NEG	oh and the girls are hotter .
POS	after turning them down , jan changes his mind ( a muddled scene - he stops his car on a bridge , looks out . . . is he feeling a sense of overachievement ? ) , and he and his team of lawyers ( tony shalhoub , zeljko ivanek , and accountant william h . macy ) head out to the town to do battle with the town's company .
POS	the battle scenes are filmed with a jerky hand-held camera , and the panic and confusion felt by the soldiers is emphasized by this technique .
POS	as graphic photos flash on a huge screen behind him , flynt strides confidently across the stage , delivering a rousing speech over what really constitutes obscenity .
POS	for his entire career , ford has been underappreciated as an actor due to his pigeonholing as an action hero .
POS	james is a mentally unbalanced child .
NEG	humor for that matter , drama , suspense , or romance .
NEG	most insulting is the subplot where important people in chris+ life appear in heaven differently than he expects , so when they finally show themselves , he realizes they were with him all along .
NEG	soon enough , fake -- and real -- blood starts to flow , and amy is being chased around by scary killer , while her cast and crew get slain , one by one .
NEG	but that would be getting ahead of myself ; besides , it's not immediately clear , as there are so many problems with the film .
NEG	reader , please understand this : i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams .
POS	it is not much that you remember of it after you leave the theater .
NEG	fouled back , right into this booth .
NEG	this film also features one of my all-time least favorite movie clich ? s : the " he would have wanted you to have this " moment , where one character gives another a trinket that yet another character is established as constantly having ( and is usually made fun of by the character who ends up getting all sappy over it later on ) .
POS	" this is the u . s . army .
NEG	but when all of his worldly possessions are blown out his 15th story window , he seeks comfort in a stranger , tyler ( pitt ) whom he met on a flight home .
POS	it is never intrusive , and adds to the drama on-screen .
POS	isn't necessarily a bad thing .
POS	this is not before he becomes one of the most respected , and often feared , men in miami .
NEG	the characters are 1-dimensional , the story thin as chicken broth , and the writing very lame .
POS	also , by not being content to utilize most of the old characters , this film gives us many new ones to enjoy .
NEG	i half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he's really austin powers .
NEG	instead of leveling the place he falls in love with lance ( alex boling ) and the two of them , along with april and her lover blatz , get married .
POS	by the end , we really start to admire the dude , who almost certainly harbors the least " aggression " of anyone in this story ; his passive resistance ( emphasis on " passive , " albeit ) to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters .
POS	kevin smith is like a big kid .
NEG	since " analyze this " bills not one , not two , but three writers , you'd think that they would have been able to work together to fix the noticably large flaws , but they must have all been on auto-pilot .
POS	tone alone cannot sustain a film , but it can go a long way .
POS	the stunts , hardware , special effects and underwater cinematography are all outstanding .
POS	i was pleasantly surprised by this film .
NEG	however , all of the drama-packed moments above were never understood because the actors and actresses sang to fast to be understood .
POS	but as he slowly begins to realize the answers , it makes him stronger and gives him a greater chance to save annie .
POS	no one seems to question the way his field documentaries seem to be shot with multiple cameras , or that his newly discovered tribesmen have startlingly blue eyes .
NEG	the big hit of the title refers to a kidnapping that happens a quarter of the way through the film .
NEG	i sincerely hope that i've completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film .
NEG	so what's this movie like ?
POS	that's why la confidential stands as the best movie of the year .
POS	" i took him by the throughout and lifted him off the ground . . . . and
POS	from elmer gantry on , we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church .
NEG	switch forward a year , christmas is approaching once again , and charlie and gabby are still having a difficult time coming to terms with jack's death .
NEG	even though the first movie wasn't a great film , it was definately an enjoyable well-made movie with an actual thin storyline .
POS	as you watch it , you go through the same emotional problems as the main character .
POS	in 1994 a little $27 , 000 movie premiered at sundance .
NEG	they don't .
POS	neve campbell gives the most layered performance of all of them , though i won't pretend that any of these characters are deep and complex .
POS	what's most impressive however , is the feature debut by writer/director jonathan mostow .
POS	is it where a person is being chased by some damned teenager who wants revenge ?
NEG	the princess di reference is in bad taste , as is much of the movie .
POS	stanley kubrick would be proud !
NEG	ancient and deadly .
POS	at the party , all of joe and ratzo's desires are made flesh ; joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami .
NEG	comments : the ex is a very bad movie .
POS	i know he won't be nominated , but this is the guy who should not be counted out when it comes time to hand out the oscar nods in february .
NEG	sir anthony hopkins isn't given much better material to work with , unfortunately .
NEG	this leads to some of the best comic scenes in the film , such as roy's process of removing horseshoes or milking the cow .
NEG	one day , he gets the opportunity to meet and marry an american g . i . , but first , he must get a sex change ( enter hedwig ) .
POS	not without evidence , and i don't have the evidence .
NEG	it's sad , because he almost actually had some decent material here , but he ruined it with his usual in your face " i'm such a renegade maverick filmmaker , look what i can do " attitude .
NEG	a stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on max's struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammy's struggles to get money and become a better person .
POS	meanwhile he slips behind a plastic curtain .
NEG	meg did fine as the sister who cries a lot , looking as adorable as ever , but someone please put lisa kudrow inside a permanent home of limited range , cause this woman basically is that very same character that she plays in every single movie/tv show that she's in .
NEG	of course , it's fine that he's slept with numerous slave girls , but the fact that his wife , a " white lady , " had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her .
NEG	although the movie never explains it , a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley .
POS	but the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves , especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce ( played by angus macfadyen ) , who wouldn't like to have a simple commoner as a national leader .
POS	however , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way .
NEG	fight club is either garbage or brilliant , but , at least right now , i must lean toward the former .
NEG	this film contains a number of cliches .
NEG	much too irreverent .
POS	he asks his members to tithe , but he gives all of his money .
NEG	hc : warren fouls off a fastball .
NEG	porter is not dead , however---not by a long shot---as he quickly rehabilitates and , along with his loyal prositute girlfriend , rosie ( maria bello ) , sets out to make everyone involved in the scam pay .
POS	bruce willis underplays his role , allowing the excellent script to do most of the work of building character development .
POS	in its own psychedelic , whacked-out way , it's sad and regretful , but i think it's also a bit of a kick in the pants , a challenge to find an alternative between chemically-induced withdrawal and the equally addictive drug of vegas-style materialism .
POS	in all , james cameron's titanic is a good blend of love story , history , and action .
NEG	and the film is a strong contender in the current race to be cruder , grosser and more outrageous than that last film .
POS	at first he is like a helpless , abandoned child , desperately reaching out for love .
NEG	and let the comedy begin !
NEG	and those are the real jokes in eddie .
NEG	the design of the numerous spacecraft and suits are all expertly drafted , with a level of realism that hasn't been seen since " 2001 : a space odyssey " .
POS	synopsis : american actress gwyneth paltrow with dark hair , playing a londoner ?
POS	his gothic saga is not meant to scare , but to display these issues differently .
POS	and so does the movie .
POS	i believe the filmmaker's view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior .
NEG	because , you see , fair game is not only a showcase for recycled action cliches and terrible acting , but also some seriously bad dialogue .
NEG	it's the last thirty minutes of the movie , then , that wrecks the film .
NEG	fourth movie , on the other hand , begins with kersey doubting the point of his violent crusades and living the quiet life with his girlfriend karen , played by kay lenz .
POS	the movie is flawless if not perfect .
NEG	because there would be no movie , that+s why .
NEG	it's like riding a bike .
NEG	there was , however , potential for this film .
NEG	( and what's with the dreary lighting ? )
NEG	the unholy union must take place on december 31 , 1999 ( you see , 999 is just 666 turned upside down ) , but only between 11 p . m . and midnight ( no wonder this guy is so cranky ) .
POS	the kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper , so i'll just say that the fights--especially the big climactic fight at the end--in themselves make the movie worth watching .
NEG	" neither have i , " rebuts perry .
POS	and along the way there is one perfect scene , which is one more than you find in most films .
NEG	there is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner , but " mandingo " never does it .
POS	it just drags in the middle , with = nothing truly happening .
POS	so is margaret a mother who accepts her son's sexual orientation and is simply trying to shield the young man from a lover she fears will take advantage of him ?
NEG	in smaller subplots , there's a pointless bit about people who are flying over l . a . ( the city in the film , by the way ) , one who's playing cards and married to a boring non-acting husband ( you think this one can go nowhere ?
POS	on april 12th , 1912 , the most astonishing shipwreck in the history of the world occurred .
POS	without him , this costly production would have gone into the ground .
POS	the film is technically impressive , especially in the scenes where the message is first received and during the destruction of the first machine .
POS	i won't reveal the rest of the story , but i'll definitely say that it turns out to be a real bummer of a night , despite the cool trophy they win .
NEG	how did these two ever get together ?
NEG	oh , did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film ?
POS	when it's all said and done , though , the vampires still kill and die with a bloody flourish ; the level for gore is indeed set to maximum .
POS	the whole film is filled with terrifying moments most coming from just seeing michael myers walk .
POS	or will kit ramsey discover what exactly is going on ?
POS	amazing grace and chuck is being advertised as a modern fairy tale , of a boy in montana who quits his little league team for a very unusual reason .
POS	and besides , it's one hell of a ride .
NEG	we don't really miss them , though .
POS	the wardens become prisoners and the civilians like wayne gayle and his producer follow the leader , no matter who it is .
POS	this might just be the finest cinematic puzzle ever created .
NEG	in the film's major sub-plot , data decides to use a chip which will give him human emotions , a chip he has had in his possession for over a year .
NEG	anyone who can't immediately tell that bob gunton ( the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films ) is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised , but i highly doubt it .
POS	he's an aging soldier who embodies the win-at-all-costs mentality , if only to impress his superior ( john travolta , in a questionable cameo ) .
POS	the book , entitled " the sixteenth round , " opens young lesra's eyes to the injustice that was carter's life , and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer .

NEG	actually , we find out he's different when we first see him , because he's the most pale individual we've ever seen and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever .
NEG	as summarized briefly in the synopsis , this is yet another spurned-psycho-lover-gets-her-revenge type movie .
POS	over the years , his marriage to obsessive pet store employee lotte ( cameron diaz ) has devolved .
POS	the movie opens via star wars , however unoriginal it may be , it worked .
NEG	unger , who made an impression in 1997's " the game , " is surprisingly wasted and it is difficult to see why she took such a part since she disappears ten minutes in , and only has two purproses : ( 1 ) to get high on heroin , and ( 2 ) because she plays a key part in an early flashback .
NEG	it is crap on toast made of crap baked in a an oven fueled by crap .
NEG	the impression left by the film wasn't overwhelming - on the contrary , there were hardly any impression at all , since i had real trouble keeping myself awake while watching it .
POS	but there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough to recommend it .
POS	with many big-budget science fiction films , great ideas are often wasted by bad scripts , cheesy plot twists , and , terrible acting .

NEG	after the huge success of " the exorcist " in 1973 a sequel was inevitable , and sadly like most horror fims that make money , the filmmakers decided to make a ridiculous sequel , that makes absolutely no sense at all , and to me was extremely pointless , wasting linda blair and max von sydow completely .

POS	her husband lem is an intense passionate individual whose temper gets the best of him sometime but never stops loving .
POS	though some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced ( some seem too cartoonish , even for this environment ) , allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrities , as it may seem to be ( if it were , it'd be extremely out-of-touch ) , but about those who want to be celebrities , and how they equate celebrity-hood with happiness .

NEG	for reasons we won't go into here , this opens the gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or the dead will rise and walk the earth .

NEG	part of the reason why the film doesn't work , i think , is that while in the original the kids' quest for sex was a coming-of-age stepping stone as much as an outlet for their horniness .
POS	swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed by both children and adults .
NEG	over 20 years ago she was the one girl who tried to help carrie .
POS	the movie is a visual banquet thanks to emmanuel lubezki's sexy cinematography ; notably , he captures a revisited fountain kiss between the two leads with a luscious , erotic charge that's steamier than the film's ( surprisingly muted ) love scenes .

POS	this man is dreadfully lonely .
NEG	other cameos , by steve buscemi and jon lovitz , provide the only real laughs in the movie .
POS	the violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized -- the imagery of a pillaged village , neatly encapsulated in the form of a child's discarded doll , is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars , and mulan's later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy , bloodless method imaginable -- yet how often does a hollywood animated film , long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent , dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner ?

POS	in a genre where one is almost always asked to allow leaps of logic , the script repeatedly astonished me with its intelligence , its attention to detail and its respect for the audience .
NEG	he's not the hero - his soulful eyes and lean build don't exactly herald a champion of shwarzenegger proportions - and " the thirteenth warrior " wisely doesn't pretend he is , allowing his foreign and physically imposing co-stars to step into the spotlight when the going gets rough .
NEG	in days , he and his comrades evolve from cave dwelling , loincloth wearing , rat eating slaves to fighter pilots and nuclear weapons experts .

NEG	dad is on hand to give fatherly yet drunken advice .
POS	all of this has the makings of a routine comedy , and the movie has its amusing moments , as when the villagers take turns giving slim gifts during a celebration of his homecoming , and they all give him birds , so by evening's end he is surrounded by turkeys , ducks , geese and other sundry fowl .
POS	if you wanted to but didn't , this is a movie for you .
NEG	plunkett & macleane marks the directing debut of jake scott , brother of ridley and tony .

POS	he's an equal opportunity bigot .
POS	neil patrick harris ( remember , he was doogie howser ) is a little wooden , and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast .

NEG	the plot for the movie involves two starving actors , maurice ( oliver platt ) and arthur ( stanley tucci ) , who accidentally end up on a cruise ship .
NEG	watching " deep rising " 's cast battle the beast is a murky chore in itself , because none of them have well-developed characters , nor do they seem to project even the slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy .

POS	in both films , the world of quickie low-budget filmmaking is explored , and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton , scott alexander , and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets -- jack's retort of " there are shadows in light , baby " to his cinematographer's complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood's " it's not about the little details , it's about the big picture !

POS	one almost wonders how they got away with the r rating .
POS	this is a movie with a brain , as smooth and calculated as the clooney and lopez characters themselves .
NEG	although events start of normal , they get weird pretty quickly , while the threesome argue more and more as the journey goes on .
POS	" the hurricane " moves quickly , with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely .
NEG	from the outset it's easy to see why some of the larger , more reputable chains aren't carrying it : the film looks like a straight-to-video release from the early '80s that's been dusted off ( not very carefully ) and re-issued in theatrical format .

POS	" existenz " has a completely different atmosphere , resembling " dark city " , which is darker , more serious and less entertaining .
POS	the battle scenes are amazing ( second only to " saving private ryan " in my opinion ) .

POS	at times i was so amazed by the computer graphics , that you can't help but just start looking at backgrounds .

NEG	supposedly , vr games are highly popular as is considered a legal-drug in this neo-reality .
POS	but what is gained in nuance and acumen is rather undermined by the sense that the material barely accommodates the 96-minute running length .

NEG	back in his former home of africa , a group of looters has found the key to locating a lost city .
NEG	it's a wacky , brewster's millions-esque premise ( acknowledged as such in one of the film's better , more self-aware lines of dialogue ) , the kind where a shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters .
POS	synopsis : in this loving film portrayal of an idyllic and pivotal time that a young boy spends with grandpa and grandma , the self recollections of an unseen narrator focus on his world view as a tennessee orphan boy learning of his heritage through his grandparents .

POS	and director vincent ward puts it all together into his final vision .
NEG	that may be because roro's background is a lot like that of the director .
POS	while novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating , impertinent and self-congratulatory ( case in point : marc rocco's unforgettable perpetual-motion helming of murder in the first ) , in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr . anderson , be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp , is purposeful and potent .
NEG	most of what comes on screen is generic sit-com level material -- the kind of slop that people will absorb while dozing off in their favorite easy chair in front of the television set .

NEG	and when the action goes sour , what is there left to enjoy ?
NEG	photography is straightforward action fare that goes through all the appropriate action flick motions - d'artagnan takes on a tavern full of thugs and bests them single-handed ; he fights a gang of febre's henchmen aboard a speeding coach to protect the queen ( with the obligatory branches hanging over the road ) ; he goes one on one with his lifelong enemy , febre , who murdered d'artagnan's folks years before .

NEG	" godzilla " opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs .

NEG	the problem with this format is that it becomes old fast , and it doesn't really fit into a movie mold .

POS	like the characters in the movie , i was constantly nervous and shaky during " final destination " .
NEG	but the laughs are built on discomfort and embarrassment , not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself .

NEG	these characters have become part of the popular mythology , and when they take over the enterprise in a moment of distress , it's a moment of high energy .
POS	in fact , the only people likely to be disappointed with the hunt for red october are those who have read the book , since films almost never live up to the novels which inspired them .
POS	the director's staging of this sequence is one of the film's more charming moments .
NEG	her incredible performance in " leaving las vegas " seems to have been a fluke .
NEG	by the end , the audience hasn't learned any more than it could have in a three-minute sketch .
POS	apocalypse now is probably one of the most memorable vietnam war films ever made .

POS	the action sequences are not a let-down , although sometimes go on too long .

POS	jim carrey was snubbed at the oscars .
NEG	there are a couple of good things about this movie .
POS	when i say that the wall-to-wall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that , once you hear them , they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity .
POS	the splendid production design seems to be straight out of tim burton's mind ; the smuntz's architecturally-unsound mansion is like something straight out of " the nightmare before christmas , " and the vortex of bizarre machinery in their factory resembles some of vincent price's warped contraptions from " edward scissorhands . "
NEG	i don+t like it when the filmmakers deviate from the question .
POS	yeoh is notable since she's so active , and has great chemistry with brosnan .
POS	helena bonham carter is delightfully pathetic and kooky in the role , and sir john gielgud , with his tongue in his cheek , embodies the height of arrogance as her father .
NEG	for the first half-hour , the ephron sisters use telephone conversations for a basis of character development .
POS	for all intents and purposes it is a bad movie ( though bad in a really good sort of way ) , but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film .
NEG	i am all for a worthwhile family movie , but sometimes an animated film comes along that is simply awful .
POS	unfortunately , a well-written script should have been considered too , because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv ( provided , of course , that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos ) .
NEG	the script even tries to fake some social conscience ( through criminally underused kay lenz's character ) and predates the war on drugs campaign that would inspire many hollywood products in next few years .
NEG	maybe it's because they're both horror films ( kinda ) , both have hot young stars , both have an annoying alternative soundtrack , and both are aimed at the teenage crowd , which i guess includes me .
POS	told from a limited third-person perspective ( as opposed to a top-down , omniscient view ) , the movie entails the struggle of an american infantry company ( " c-for-charlie " ) to take a hill during the conflict at guadalcanal .
POS	altogether good performances were put in by all the cast and the director blended everything marvelously with the necessary special effects to create a good movie .
POS	the story sounds very simple , and perhaps even unexciting , but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron , a good movie comes through .

NEG	sounds pretty good , doesn't it .
NEG	more than 80 yemeni men , women , and children are mowed down .
POS	an odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass-market commercial sensibilities , this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years , but falls short of actualizing its potential .
POS	the only area where the film really lacks is the cameo department .
POS	we just don't know when or how horrible it will be .
POS	jack treats a locked front door like a welcome mat , even at his associates' homes .
NEG	i wondered if there were jokes that i wasn't getting because i'm not from china , but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldn't be attributed to the cultural barrier either .
NEG	seven years later , for the third instalment , he used the directorial service of john landis , another fading star , with whom he successfully collaborated twice - in trading places and coming to america .
NEG	for the supporting cast , disney manage to assemble every character actor out there , during the film i was going 'he was the guy in . . . ah . . er . . . '
POS	old ways die hard , though , and old associates pull carlito step by step back into a life he can't seem to shake .
NEG	comments : malicious , i suppose , is an acceptable moview for what it is : a cheap , b-movie thriller which rips off dozens and dozens of spurned-psycho-lover-who-wants-revenge films ( like fatal attraction , hand that rocks the cradle , etc . etc . ) that have come before it .
POS	the real stars , of course , are the computer-generated martians , and they're fantastic .

NEG	gregg araki obviously has seen such films as " easy rider , " " natural born killers , " and " kalifornia , " and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like a pop culture reference guide .
NEG	charlize was narrowly beat out by elizabeth berkley for the lead role in the " movie " , showgirls .
NEG	you'd think he's sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him !
POS	the radical departure was that they decided to use the medium of animation to make a biblical epic , a la cecil b . demille , to move our hearts and minds rather than to tickle our funny bones .
POS	the land is under siege .
NEG	let's put the `secret' on hold for now , and discuss the trip there .
POS	at training camp , mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits ( easily characterized simply as the short clown , the skinny clown , and the big clown ) , who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness , and , in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns , she grows a certain fondness for a handsome , square-jawed young captain , shang .
NEG	it's charmless , molasses-slow and so full of genuinely stupid people that the film commission of atlanta , where the real mccoy is set , might well consider some sort of ritual suicide for their complicity in this humiliation .
NEG	zellwegger , who is kidnapped by " the family " early on , keeps trying to have normal conversations with these people .
NEG	one does not have to go to the movies to see entertainment like this .

NEG	on his return , he promises her the world and professes his undying love .
POS	john travolta plays the local big-shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself and not the bumbling russ richards .
NEG	thus , there just isn't enough material to sustain the 83-minute movie .
POS	mr . reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective .
POS	but again , the lines they say are usually pretty good , and they do have some funny parts .
POS	some have labeled " blood simple as a modern-day noir , but , while i am not an expert on either genre , it seems more like a horror movie than anything else .
NEG	it probably happens due to poorly executed genre mix , that collides light-hearted romantic comedy with rather uninteresting plot suitable to pure action thrillers .
POS	the number can't be counted on one hand , unless of course you're the victim of some hideous genetic mutation .
NEG	they keep score of their scoring with points given for each conquest .
POS	it's an uncanny blend of action and surreal fantasy that borrows from dozens of other films ( most obviously the terminator films , star wars , and total recall ) , but remains refreshingly original and interesting throughout .
NEG	this movie sucks because it was slow and boring , starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past , included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best and pissed at worst , and certified it all with many a predictable ending .
NEG	unfortunately , `ready to rumble' is not being helmed by the farrelly brothers , nor is it bolstered by a script that accommodates the viewer with anything even remotely clever or inspired .
POS	they don't just present you with a string of dick and fart jokes ( although there are plenty to go around ) .
NEG	in a film that tries obsessively to shock , one dream sequence portrays a family in a car accident .
POS	u-571 looked like another action film using an actual war as an excuse to shoot torpedoes and bullets .
POS	the nazis put me in a concentration camp , but life is still beautiful .

POS	on the other hand , it is absolutely no mystery why denzel washington agreed to play rubin " hurricane " carter .
NEG	by the time the sigh-inducing climax hits , the believability and complete absence of focus leave one ready to leave the theater .
POS	critique : " i feel like shooting myself in the head " are the first words that came out of my mouth after seeing this movie , a good indication as to what kind of film to expect here .
POS	its views of science and religion will no doubt aggrivate some , but will stimulate more .
NEG	the conclusion is more ludicrous than convincing .
POS	and yes , that is a great film worthy of the recognition it has been getting .
POS	the two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell , but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore ( and there are quite a few ) .
POS	nothing is quite as it seems , and you can't really tell which side one person is on .
POS	it is one of many science fiction films , released during the last year of this millenium , that tackles issues that will play an important role in our future .
NEG	at first you marvel at the elegant direction , graceful cinematography and sensual musical score .
POS	on the other hand , lee was more believable hero than bond ; deprived of guns and super-tech gadgets , he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive .

POS	the art design is impeccable in its tawdriness , and director aki kaurism ? ki often matches the colour of characters' clothes with the background colour and/or lighting , so that it seems as if they are almost physically fading into the environment .
POS	it isn't long after that , that his girlfriends start realizing what a jerk he really is and well . . . it's
NEG	the king's sorcerer , amblyn ( who also lost his job ) , decided to take abraham under his wing as an apprentice .
NEG	and forcing her to write " i still exist " in her diary , imo , is just too tacky .
POS	a compelling , at times poignant film , it manages to maintain its truthfulness while teetering between comedy and melodrama .
POS	everything comes together in a bourgeois housewarming party for odile's place , as the characters reveal their true feelings and all their deceptions and neurotic impulses are either uncovered or about to be .
NEG	gonna cry again !
POS	the performances of watson and griffiths are excellent in style and substance .
NEG	very funny !
NEG	cruise grins a little too slyly .
POS	even without having seen a cowboys and indians movie , somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema .
NEG	in the end it seems as if they have all been intensively working on a ravishingly looking soap opera .
NEG	even without quaid , it doesn't appear that switchback would have stayed on course .
NEG	i've seen his name around recently ( he was one of the toucher-uppers on the armageddon script ) , and i imagine that , for the most part , he knows what he's doing when it comes to screenwriting .
NEG	it just wasn't the type of film you can see him doing .
NEG	this opening sequence is very boring and slow .
POS	almost .
NEG	at first , i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes , but when the movie got rolling , my interest suddenly stopped .
NEG	the film stars ally sheedy and lance henrikson in a tale of bio-genetics gone wrong .
NEG	we are apparently supposed to be upset that tim robbins character removes his helmet in deep space and kills himself to save his wife , but i felt extreme boredom coupled with a twinge of disinterest .
POS	on a similar note , whitney houston's cover of " the greatest love of all " is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isn't the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source .
POS	and " how far would you go ? "
POS	kurosawa is not going for and easy visual shock , but a deeper metaphysical dread .

NEG	eve marks ( meg ryan ) just put her father lou mozell ( walter matthau ) into a hospital .
POS	director brett ratner ( the family man ) keeps it moving at an entertaining pace and manages to keep the laughs coming despite the fairly miserable hit to miss ratio of the jokes ( i guess sometimes the shotgun approach works ) .
NEG	several times i tried to prevent myself from laughing , without succeeding .
NEG	from minute one to minute ninety-seven , there's hardly a moment when the wavering , skilled voice of an opera singer or the rhythms of the gypsy music don't undercut the action ; the notes stricken both overwhelm ( particularly john turturro , portraying fictional opera singer dante dominio , whose money and reputation catch lola's interest ) and accompany ( oftentimes , the perfect chords are captured to undermine the state of the film's characters and reinforce that state ) .
NEG	it's quite funny to see a film indulge , with the straightest of faces , in all those cheesy horror movie cliches that wes craven lampooned so well ( and so recently ) in scream .
POS	, high +2 ( -4 to +4 )

POS	this is exactly what happened in this movie , but fortunately , they managed to do it in an interesting and funny way .
NEG	mcconaughey is then drafted in as his lawyer , and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics .
POS	it's an old story , you know -- forbidden love ala romeo and juliet -- but it works , and jack's " rescuing " rose ( in both literal and figurative senses ) and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching .
POS	for those in need of a ready answer , might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl's fleabag hotel .
POS	so , despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top 100 of all times , enter the dragon is a incredibly entertaining piece of cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who don't like that particular genre .
NEG	perry might have the charm but he doesn't have the physical attributes of a traditional leading man , especially in close-up .

POS	things begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half , as they are up against impossible odds : the judge ( john lithgow ) is not only a strickler , but a pal of facher ; the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify ; no concrete evidence is being found , depsite the money spent to find it ; and they are quickly running out of money .
NEG	her accent also comes and goes , though it's nowhere near as glaring as the total lack of chemistry between her and co-star john malkovich .
POS	i think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue , which is amazing .
NEG	his wife celia ( barbara hershey ) is perpetually in a pill-induced haze ; his son george ( lukas haas ) is a flamboyant lounge singer who goes by the stage name " bunny . "
POS	there's also the element of the japanese action cartoon ( called anime by aficionados ) , especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects .
NEG	his insomnia , coupled with his compulsive desires to fill his world with ikea furniture to ? complete ? himself , make him a loser at the game of life .
POS	this combination works well more often than it fails , but when it does fail , the humor really seems cheesy .
NEG	capsule : silly and inane adaptation of gibson's short story , which is nowhere in sight .
POS	it's hard to give a plot summary without giving away pieces that shouldn't be known .
NEG	characters who may ( wink wink ) turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow ; cutaway inserts of the captain campbell's still-living face after the corpse is uncovered insure against five-minute attention spans .
POS	in this age of cynicism , it's refreshing to see a movie so upbeat .
NEG	when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain , you know that you can expect nothing more than a b grade action movie .
POS	brandy in particular was impressive , considering this is her first feature film .
NEG	there is a desperate sense of deja vu presiding over this movie ; the computer-animated dinos are no longer novel or exciting , and even the first-time presence of aerial lizards scarcely improves the situation .
NEG	however , when asked how he learned the language , he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from late-night kung-fu films , and soon gained mastery .
POS	common complaints range from lack of characterization , weak narrative , poor direction of actors , the dated style , and too much focus over special effects .

NEG	he knows everything about some characters , nothing about others .
POS	meanwhile , television reporter max brackett ( dustin hoffman ) is also on the scene .
NEG	director todd holland completely fails to develop any character into something more substantial than a device to implement various dubious gags .
POS	mostly due to the fact that it was pretty well recycled from a dozen other action flicks .
NEG	you'll like it .
NEG	never mind that it's not clear how the brothers end up fighting suited bad guys inside an automobile crash-testing facility .
POS	this is not a film of good people beset from without by great evil .
NEG	she was known as one joann witty back then .
NEG	dante's peak has a singular talent for pointing out the obvious .
POS	casting " doogie howser " star neil patrick harris as mind-reading military intelligence is only one of the guilty pleasures of " starship troopers , " a hugely entertaining , mega-budgeted sci-fi yarn directed by paul verhoeven , who's making quite a recovery from his 1995 g-string epic " showgirls . "
NEG	there is some solid acting there , something that is not carried through the rest of the film .
POS	we all know the fate of " child's play , " which is the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially : sequel hell .

NEG	sgt .
POS	kids won't care about most of the special features on this dvd , but those of us who can sometimes be turned into a " kid at heart " thanks to a winning family film sure appreciate them .
NEG	hungry for recognition , micelli sets up interviews , lectures , etc . in an effort to make this the biggest sociological event in history , a sure fire way to go down in the history books .
NEG	there are other questions that i had , but the real problem was that the story ( little of it that there was ) offered no characters to love or hate .
POS	she also has a fiesty attitude ( " i'm gonna kill ya ! "
NEG	i'll leave you with the final line of dialogue in the movie .
POS	hmm . well , the movie goes through twists and turns , having some sad moments and happy ones , until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan " hook up " , to use modern terminology , and kiss their way into happiness .
POS	long review ===========
NEG	the problem is , aside from a few genuinely inspired bits , there's not much that's funny here .

POS	it fails to resolve many of its own plot twists and philosophical questions .
POS	" sweet sweetback " is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers .
POS	which features , in my opinion , the best fight scene ever recorded on film , as ripley straps herself into a huge robot and battles the nasty queen alien to the death .
POS	this film has taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at the audience .
POS	a lot of times a three-star film will be my favorite .
NEG	sgt .
POS	while mary and henry are evidently less than sincere in their affections , their presence does provide the movie and the main characters with the necessary conflict that keeps our interest until the film's appropriately austen-like ending .
POS	my advice is to catch it .
NEG	the nostalgic elements ( best friend , favorite teacher , first crush , etc . ) have been done much better in other movies , and actually seem more like filler here .
NEG	there are many other ideas , all of which are a hundred times better than what+s unraveled in the plot .
NEG	it's a dissatisfying spectacle , a very weak sister of a very good movie .
POS	while rush hour is not at the same level as police story 3 and 4 ( known in north america as supercop and jackie chan's first strike , respectively ) , it more than makes up for the poorly received films operation condor and mr . nice guy .
NEG	who knows , eh ?
NEG	have her accidentally incite a riot with biker dudes and scantily clad babes !
NEG	it a little better than just okay novel and it makes a film that is not even that good .

POS	but tommy does hedwig wrong , stealing her songs and becoming a superstar .
POS	ray thinks this means that he must travel to boston to meet terence mann , an influential and radical novelist from the '60s who has since stopped writing and dropped out of society .
NEG	i didn't hate the big hit , even though it is a stupefyingly terrible film .
NEG	the script has a few lapses , namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower , no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage .
NEG	then we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey , one of the other band members .
POS	this being already has predestined when and how you will die .
NEG	and of course , the ending itself leaves possibility for a sequel .
POS	only her wise , dark eyes reveal her age .
POS	after a rather disappointing " mary railly " , stephen frears is now officially back in business with a comeback worthy of praise .
NEG	the story of this static and highly unsympathetic character is told with a number of often clumsy stylistic experiments .
POS	the last dozen or so that i have seen have all felt incomplete , as if the most crucial scene was deleted in order to obtain a more lucrative rating .
POS	and for no reason whatsoever , except 'cause he was so good in " goldeneye , " joe don baker shows up again as wade , admitting he has no reason for being there , and is this time more annoying .

NEG	john ritter stars as zach , a dried up writer and insatiable womanizer with a big-time drinking problem .
NEG	mi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act , which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won't stop .
NEG	not only has the first two films' unsettling insight into what it would really take for someone to make himself into a " superhero " been abandoned , but this one throws any lingering realism out the window and goes for all-out camp with few traces of the self-mocking restraint of the relatively light-hearted third installment .
NEG	there is enough cleavage in this movie to satisfy russ meyer .
NEG	oh joy !
POS	it's a complicated , unforgettable film that , like the ice storm two years ago , dares to explore the darkest reaches of suburban life .
POS	his direction is smooth and stylish .
POS	it gives it a deadpan feel , which makes it all the more funnier and odder .
NEG	sadly , all we get is quick glimpses into their lives , although a movie about any of them would have been far more intriguing than the story burns has chosen to tell .

POS	in the grand scheme of mel gibson movies , payback was better than conspiracy theory , but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon .
POS	maybe they were being merciful , on reflection .
POS	almost completely taken over by her own shame , she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother-in-law's requests , even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman .
POS	the character of stuart , while obviously a computer generated image , grows on you as the film progresses and you'll soon see him as much more than a mere special effect .
NEG	by the time the general's daughter wanders towards its over-wrought , psycho-in-the-rain finale , west's heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun .
NEG	and now , director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies .
POS	unfortunately , being that he is a computer-generated character , tells a bit about the direction of the actors ( although natalie portman as the queen is pretty effective , as is jake lloyd as the young anakin skywalker ) .
NEG	had terrence malick concentrated on the great performances of nolte and koteas as well as those by sean penn , woody harrelson , and john cusack , he could have made a truly great film .
NEG	even though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor , his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality .

POS	the situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter .
POS	his romance with the separated woman , like the rest of the film , doesn't follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies .

POS	the characters still talk in his trademark staccatto lines and there is still tension present in conversations that no ordinary writer would be able to make tense .
POS	there's a delightful little scene where banderas and jones have a sword fight , and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed , until jones clothes fall off all together .
POS	it's extremely intriguing and suspenseful , but it's also quite fun .

NEG	with the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance , `the messenger' looked like a timeless epic in the making .
POS	the ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously , but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is , you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller .

NEG	willis has barely a chance to come alive ; ditto for affleck .
POS	the film begins in a classroom , with nearly all the main characters present .
POS	and it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship ( including some shocks - dan hedaya , for instance , who's death is comical yet sad since , well , he's dan hedaya ) , and the remaining people ( about 7 or 8 ) are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth .

NEG	there's something about an evil gadget taking over the city ( his first crime must have been swiping matt dillon's dentures from there's something about mary ) and it all ends with ( what else ? ) a bunch of post-credit nonsense and a cameo by don adams himself .
NEG	while in most of his famed films , his penchant for gore always hit the right note with theme of the film and plot .
NEG	he works with a few other hitmen--cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) , crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) , and vinnie ( antonio sabbato , jr . ) .
NEG	this was a flat presentation , hardly touching an emotional button on what all the fuss was about over ned kelly's call for justice .

NEG	human patrick is given a tongue that also has a tongue within itself , and his alien form more closely resembles the alien than eve's alien body ( which ironically was designed by alien designer h . r . giger ) .
NEG	this doesn't really happen ; nearly every supporting character learns about charlie's condition early on , so they don't have any opportunity to be surprised by it .
POS	the visuals are also amazing .
NEG	too many of the would-be shocks are fakeouts reliant on bombastic music cues , and the film's chase scenes are riddled with the cliches that _scream_ tried to subvert , like screaming damsels knowingly running themselves into dead ends when they should--and could--run out the front door .

NEG	going into the theater , preliminary comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable , but by the twenty-minute mark , when i had chuckled once and laughed nary a single time , it was clear this production was in serious trouble .
NEG	there are individual scenes and ideas that work -- i like the thought of a sentient computer program -- but none of the film's strengths are recognized to any meaningful degree .
POS	in this movie , however , he seems much less interested in income redistribution than in fighting for his king and country .
NEG	from the outset , jimmy's motivation isn't cash ; it's the livelihoods of his devoted employees .
POS	proyas' use of models gives an appropriately eerie unreality to the film's world ( for not only does the audience see the city a model , but so do the ghouls ) .
NEG	he's at his best in the film when his nice guy persona fades a little ( such as when he has a breakdown on stage during a wedding reception ) .

POS	it never really comes to a satisfying conclusion , which is a shame , as most films are too long !
POS	and although they at least didn ? t have anyone get hacked to death with a knife , the coens also aren't quite immune to horror cliches ; they indulge in a prolonged dead-guy-seems-to-have-come-back-to-life-but-then-we-find-out-it's-only-a-dream scene that had me rolling my eyes .

POS	critics who don't like the movie , especially those who can't forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of " new hollywood " , are prone to point the lack of originality .
NEG	offensive in the way it continues a trend of poking fun at career criminals who wouldn't think twice about pushing your mother-in-law off the brooklyn bridge with her feet encased in concrete .
POS	consequently , it's a bit incongruous to see this cheery sweet-faced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates , but in a scene where she's lounging in a limousine prowling the streets , garish red lipstick messily smeared on , giving the camera a hilariously pouty come-hither look , all one can do is gulp .

NEG	the story boils down to the demons trying to correct their mistake .

NEG	in the end , although the film provided some entertainment , viewers , at least critical ones , would probably be happy to know that there aren't any plans for beverly hills iv .

POS	they encounter two hillbillies , armed with a shotgun , who captured them .
POS	there is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization : skyscrapers , hospitals , televisions , highways , etc . but , it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land , or else they are simply ignorant of it .

NEG	hunter s . thompson's fear and loathing in las vegas , written in 1971 , is already an american classic ; not merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the post-psychedelia of the 1960's , but also because it ushered in a new form of journalism known as " gonzo " .

POS	inspired by f . w . murnau's 1922 silent film of the same name , herzog's film is a work of exquisite bleakness , an oddly touching tragedy with a beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards .
NEG	after the setup , in which the robinson family--father john ( william hurt , looking and sounding as spaced out as he does in interviews ) , mother maureen ( rogers , wasted ) , daughters judy ( heather graham , ditto ) and penny ( a heavily made-up chabert , looking like a junior version of neve campbell in wild things ) , and son will ( young newcomer johnson , making the best of it ) --and pilot don west ( leblanc , doing a bad han solo impression ) find themselves lost in space after their ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway dr . smith ( a watered-down but still-lively oldman , cashing a paycheck and loving every minute ) , the script's " stream " of events becomes so fragmented and random that it seems to be made up as it goes along--and hopkins does little to make what does go on the slightest bit interesting .
POS	this femme-butch-femme triangle is what provides the film with considerable humanity * and * sensuality .
POS	and , perhaps the best sequence : a romp with hot-as-hell teen idol , brandon darrow , played by none other than leo dicaprio , who is so un-dicaprio-esque that if any of this fans could sit through this film , they'd never look at him the same way .

POS	the tight and realistic scripts with memorable characters ( portrayed by such capable actors like john turturro , dean stockwell , debra feuer , darlanne fleugel and steve james ) gave opportunity for friedkin to use another gimmick that made him famous in his 1971 masterpiece - great car chase .
POS	at another point , bianca and kat's father ( a stand-out larry miller ) , who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant , only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion : before she leaves , she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it's like to be pregnant .

POS	" sweet sweetback " is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era , although van peebles disassociates " sweetback " from other movies like " shaft " ( 1972 ) and " the mack " ( 1973 ) , because those were financed by big hollywood studios .
POS	while much of the film's humour pertains to the characters' obliviousness of now-outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society -- a prime example is part-time salesman buck swope's demo of a stereo system with an eight-track tape , and inviting a prospective customer to get 'freaky deaky' with the music -- it's elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule , but of wistful reminiscence , and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous .

POS	secret service millieu was also cleverly used in order to bring the viewer into the decade of greed ; the beginning scene where the movie's hero works as a part of presidential security detail is a nice opportunity to hear reagan's speech that could illustrate the political and economical notions of those times .
POS	facher is seen as an elderly man , a goofy eccentric , carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it , eating lunches out of paper bags , and making a point to take time out of his day to listen to the radio , and scold anyone who interupts him .
POS	schlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe's virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals , signifying emasculation .
POS	mostow , hitherto directed the showtime thriller flight of a black angle , alleviates the contrivances and generics of the script by gingerly pursuing the trajectory of the plot , efficiently letting the tone and the mood of the story generate that nail-biting suspense sought for in a well- made affair .

NEG	but now , in new york , we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son , and his character is desperate enough to involve max in a disturbing giant vs . midgets wrestling match , which i found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film .
NEG	the biggest flaw is that 20 minutes into this film , kay chandler ( kristin scott thomas ) and dutch van den broeck ( harrison ford ) are the only two major characters alive ; resulting in little doubt that they will end up together at some point during the laborious two-hours-and-then-some production .

NEG	i caught the winner at its world premiere at the toronto international film festival in september 1996 , and in fairness it is entirely possible that the film has been extensively revamped since then due to the lacklustre audience reaction generated - there were more walkouts on this film than any of the others i screened .

NEG	my advice to scott glenn ( absolute power ) and suzy amis ( titanic ) is to accidentally forget this film the next time they're making out a resume .
POS	the jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie : ribisi is confident when it's just him and the phone , but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father ( authoritatively played by ron rifkin ) .

POS	but , of course , it's not all action- there's a message here as well that has to do with family .
NEG	goldblum is actually quite good , but it's hard for the audience to sustain much interest in his character and spiritual journey when the director doesn't seem to be much interested , either .
POS	american beauty is just the kind of uncompromising film hollywood needs every now and then to counterbalance the mindless drivel we see released ; even more so considering it's a masterpiece .
POS	besides casting jovovich , besson's only mistake is his extreme sense of patriotism that in the end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting .

POS	while " the gingerbread man " isn't in league with altman's greatest works like " nashville " ( 1975 ) or " the player " ( 1992 ) , it is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking , which may prove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career .

POS	sadly , the rest of the film , while pretty good , doesn't quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on making this film look so darn good .
NEG	there is no quota , no need for you to make a picture a year .
POS	the story of stuart , though , is a tougher sell because he's the everyman , and when you can't totally identify with the everyman , your story's in slight trouble .
POS	" lucky numbers " is a perfect example of this because it's such a blatant rip-off of " fargo " and every movie based on an elmore leonard novel and yet it somehow still works for me .
POS	we get that he's talented , okay , let's move on .

POS	director curtis hanson has perfectly framed each character , letting you see into them , rooting for them one moment , doubting them the next .

NEG	the performances range from commanding ( travolta ) to electric ( woods ) to stiff-as-a-board ( cromwell , who doesn't show off his real talents here ) .

POS	now i haven't seen too many recent french films , i will admit , but if this is the kind of " scene " that they're developing over in " le pays du vin " , i wouldn't mind catching more of their flicks in the future ( crimson rivers was another french film that i saw earlier this year , which i really liked- ironically , that film was directed by mathieu kassovitz , who is the co-star in this film ) .

NEG	it goes for every cheap tear imaginable , wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene .
NEG	lack of dialogue makes him the ultimate caricature .
POS	slapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy , but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced : you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash face-first into a pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people don't watch where they're going .

NEG	the actor isn't used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks ; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment , be it during a gunfight , before one or after one .

NEG	after an ingenuous opening showing pongo's morning routine as he gets daniels prepared for the day , the film quickly tumbles into lame slapstick as the pooch drags daniels on a careening trek through a city park . a little slapstick goes a long way , but hughes just keeps laying it on .

NEG	compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it's no longer funny , merely gross .

NEG	the characters just wander around the city aimlessly and bump into each other for no apparent reason , and that's what moves the plot .

NEG	although the supporting characters are equally stupid themselves since they tell him everything which comes back to haunt them in one violent way or another .
POS	and while mr . anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters , it's problematic that some of the the threads given to the film's characters are simply stale material -- julianne moore's child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff , better suited for a less risque and uninspired tv-movie version of her character's story , and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions .
NEG	he has confused profundity with pretentiousness .
NEG	i thought maybe arraki was improving in his craft .

POS	verbal kint is a clever storyteller , weak , oppressed , and gleefully evil to the bone , yet pitiful , one who draws sympathy .
NEG	then some characters have sex .
NEG	the performances aren't bad : carlyle and miller are typical lads , but liv tyler is a huge disappointment as the love interest .
POS	of course , the movie has some slightly sentimental bits , but they don't drag the movie's humor content down that bad .
POS	larry flynt is certainly among the very best studio-released films of 1996 , and works both as a ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression , and as a touching love story .
NEG	hopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts .
NEG	.
NEG	" the red violin " promises much , but delivers little .
NEG	the script is 100% recycled , the direction is hokey , and the acting is absolutely horrible .
POS	the really superb achievement of this film is that during its flashbacks , it successfully creates for the audience what it must have felt like to be in that era , but with the added perk of knowing the result of all that goes down .

NEG	summary : r . a . m . r .
POS	especially the evil alien , he did need some work .
POS	michael rooker is credible as henry from the first frame , just standing there , and the rest of the cast works by being unaffected and casual as well .
NEG	perhaps " hush " 's title is a plea to silence its audience's likely bitter word of mouth while exiting the theater .
POS	following the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war .
NEG	written , directed by , and starring the infamous takeshi kitano ( kikujiro , sonatine ) brother is his first film made outside his familial japan , bringing the yakuza tradition to los angeles .
POS	" dangerous beauty " contains just enough bare flesh and ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic , but not so much that it seems exploitative .

NEG	it at least provides us with a look at courtney's personality but the way the scene finishes doesn't make any sense .
POS	it's not only the name of the mysterious ( and possibly even mythical ) crime boss in the movie , it also sums up the movie -- " keyser soze " in latin means " an intelligent crime mystery story from up-and-coming director bryan singer . "
NEG	i didn't hate it -- it's simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins ; furthermore , most of the acting is quite good .
POS	it wasn't until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally ( and perfectly ) paced in order to give the audience ample time to re-connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached .

NEG	that is not all , however .
POS	they attack in packs of hundreds , and it's a funny , scary sight to see these bugs take repeated hits and still crawl , jerk and struggle towards their intended victims in a determined , gooey mess .
NEG	instead of pip , this time the central character is named finn ( played as a boy by jeremy kissner , and by ethan hawke as an adult ) .
NEG	it's a well-acted ( particularly look for dennis franz cutting against type-casting as a happy-go-lucky fallen angel ) , well-filmed , and based on a wonderful idea .
NEG	once they reach space , we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong-perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes .
NEG	it keeps you about 700 miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close ?

NEG	there's never a moment of awe , wonder , or mayhem .
POS	had it faithfully explored that = aspect , than the dichotomy of jesus' soul , his frailties and doubt mixed = with his unmistakable glory , would have been simply spectacular .
POS	" les vacances de m . hulot " is not subtitled , but the dialogue is sparse and for the most part not terribly essential to the flow of events .
NEG	i on the other hand appreciated the fact that the producers and director knew exactly what they were doing : insulting my intelligence , and brought adequate movie-making skills to the project a movie does not have to be good to be well made , at least in terms of the craft .
NEG	but he ably shows that it's not the size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the dog .

NEG	how else to explain the jay and silent bob cameo ( the slacker duo of kevin smith movies ) , akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan and more distracting than funny .
NEG	he's feeling somewhat dissatisfied with his relationship with his live-in love , mary ( catherine keener ) , who holds some subconscious hostility toward the male gender .

NEG	the visual effects are just stunning , from the space walk sequences , to the visualization of evolution on earth .
NEG	the spook scenes are short and far between , and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same amount of fear that these scenes provide .
POS	i have to admit , the first time i saw this , i saw it with my family , including my 11 year old kid sister .

POS	andrew niccol is responsible for the screenplay and peter weir pulled it off to perfection .
NEG	" i'm a lesbian " ( which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular ) is also pretty good , but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms . smith .
NEG	in fact , this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid campiness !

NEG	now , toilet humour can be funny , as dumb and dumber ( 1994 ) humorously showed .
NEG	but you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy . . .
POS	even if " rebel without a cause " has some ridiculous scenes ( the game of chicken - did people really act this way ? ) , an unbelievable conclusion ( how did everyone end up at the abandoned mansion at the end ? ) , and a silly romance ( wood declares her love for dean after talking to him for a couple hours ) it still is a fabulous film .
NEG	the characters were as empty as the story , and the film was an easy one to forget .
NEG	thus begins the long adventure to help save the thermians .

POS	" fiction " has spawned so many imitations , i've lost count .
POS	the film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset ; although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately , it's startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulan's land .

POS	although the film is very long , the plot keeps chugging along , and there's barely a dull moment .
POS	the setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself .
NEG	these sub plots could have made for semi-interesting points , but the film seems afraid to explore politics or mother-daughter relations in depth , and consequently suffers .
POS	everything you see in the film is rendered in great detail : individual threads in the fabric , individual strands of hair swaying , wrinkles and pimples on skin , incredible water effects .

NEG	i am sure that if the hard nosed detective cruz were to see this movie , she'd walk out after about 5 minutes , and you'd be well advised to do the same if you should happen to find yourself in a theater showing it .

POS	in doing so , the film transports us into a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen in the original .
POS	he brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience .
NEG	every bit of male-ego-stroking dialogue that wyatt's third wife speaks to him made me sick to listen to it .
NEG	the lighting is poor at best , which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes , and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words , and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able to understand some simple portuguese and spanish phrases .

POS	the film starts off very slowly with a somewhat weak opening action sequence and another uneventful half an hour to introduce several of the sailors ( most of whom die when the mission goes awry or just inexplicably disappear ) .

POS	and as with pulp fiction , the music is a highlight , bringing back memorable songs from the 70s and 80s .
POS	the romance is prodded along before it has a chance to transform into something special .
POS	in his attempt to gain a fuller semblance of who she is , he opens wounds that hadn't existed before by single-handedly corrupting the fantasy .

POS	the quick script written by barry fanaro , screenwriter of kingpin , is carried by plenty of subtly dry humor and wit .
POS	american beauty is an extraordinary film , a powerful , jolting exploration of the dark side of the american dream .
POS	starship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem .
NEG	the really scary aspect of this sequel is how disappointing it really is .
POS	especially all of the scenes that involved anything underwater ( the tunnel , of course , starts to flood ) .
NEG	the script has a fundamental problem : annie gives up , for little reason , her life with walter to pursue " sleepless in seattle , " whom she has never even seen .
NEG	at first , all harry is expected to do is provide a threatening voice on the phone , and to collect the money ( of which he gets to keep 10% ) .
POS	suffice to say that this artfully paced study of a woman suffering a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot , loads of atmosphere and solid acting , though the dialogue is somewhat weakened by the dubbing into english .
POS	truer words were never spoken .
NEG	suffice to say , the comedy in " the whole nine yards " works about as well as the broken-down lawnmower in my backyard , and when a giggle surprisingly arises every twenty to thirty minutes , it is by sheer luck .

POS	the second act is as immersive , brilliant , and haunting as any film that i have ever seen .

NEG	on the plus side , however , the film's closing image shows some promise for a potentially interesting ( but unlikely ) sequel .
NEG	it actually , at least to me , sounds like it would work , and with scott rosenberg , that witty penmen who has written stuff like " beautiful girls " and " things to do in denver when you're dead " ( as well as " con air " ) , it actually sounds like it may be pulled off with the right amount of frights and satiric wit .

NEG	the film could be enjoyably campy if it didn't take itself so damn seriously .
NEG	also , the cast , consisting of cameos from dozens of washed up ex tv stars ( including christopher knight , eve plumb , shannen doherty , and david leisure ) was promising .
POS	this is a very real debate but contact boils it down to a simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved .
POS	there are one or two instances of jerky editing .
NEG	the brothers' earlier film wasn't funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected .

NEG	there's little suspense following the quake , although this film tries for it .
NEG	worst of these is a ludicrous bit involving that '70s show's wilmer valderrama and beverly d'angelo , both of whom appear in the film simply to provide a nutty mrs . robinson-like substory and to remind you of how much better done that was in bull durham .
POS	inside , anything went and , we are told , everything did .
POS	reeves , whom i've never really cared for as an actor , is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness , and little subtlety .

POS	while boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging , there really isn't any clever dialogue in the film , though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film's characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges ; when one considers that the film's * protagonist * literally doesn't say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time , it's no wonder why the playfully inane " how much can you bench ? "
POS	surprisingly , that's really all i can tell you about the plot .
POS	it's almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man's uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audience's throat .

POS	travolta is great in his role and even though he's not a really likable character , he's trying to be a nice guy despite the fact he's a creep .
POS	when he denies her something , she blackmails him effortlessly ( a scene involving a rocking chair and a little foot action is damn near classic ) , and when he stands up to her , she weeps and runs away , leaving humbert to follow her .
NEG	i have news for you , eric : no wrestling fan in this day and age is dumb enough to believe that professional wrestling isn't for show , unless they are four years old .
POS	ricky fitts ( wes bentley ) serves as the film's thematic center , providing the obscure , powerful meaning of the title .
POS	despite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young up-and-comers ( including reese witherspoon ) , most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos .

POS	if we don't support great sf , who will ?
NEG	_dawson's_creek_ star jackson mugs his way thorugh a glorified cameo ; gayheart displays all the depth and range of , well , a noxzema spokeswoman ; and robert englund lends the film little more than his freddy krueger pedigree as a folklore professor .
NEG	so in a film where the one liners come as bad as earth man , what a shit hole and the primary means for one mans strategic attack is to bounce bullets off walls to hit an opponent , its no wonder why alien : resurrection turned out to be as off putting and clumsy as it is .
POS	could it be that finally , an indie-film has unwittingly found a formula for commercial appeal ?

POS	in one scene , he allows local children to look at his mother through their window , displaying her like a side show attraction .
POS	and maybe , " second best " is even a greater picture .
NEG	while certainly better than 1978's " king kong lives " ( itself a lousy sequel to a not particularly good remake ) , " mighty joe young " proves how the mighty keep falling .
POS	out of all of these moves , however , the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation , " 10 things i hate about you , " is this past january's mediocre , ho-hum " she's all that . "
POS	the animation is on par with some of disney's best .
NEG	unfortunately , that's firestorm's lone asset , and it falters near the end , when computer-generated special effects fill up the screen .

NEG	here , she could easily be mistaken for melanie griffith .
NEG	so , patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients .
NEG	banks and horta's ( intentional ) attempts at humor are also lame ; the fact that the best gags are lazy , in-jokey references to the other credits of co-stars joshua jackson and rebecca gayheart says a lot about the imagination of their humor .
POS	sorry about the segue , or lack thereof .
NEG	yet he still seems like no threat -- perhaps because he seems too stupid to threaten connor , or maybe because his two best assassins wouldn't have been amiss with larry , curly and mo .

POS	when his rubin " hurricane " carter feels pain and is tormented by racism , he creates for the audience a great sense of sympathy , disgust , and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices .
POS	but this film just seems to end , and i don't want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on : imagine , if you will , being one of those the film is about , looking forward to this film , and then discovered the truth has been through a surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter , just so the many won't bitch about what is , essentially , genuine .
NEG	perhaps sci-fi spectaculars are just not an actor's medium .

POS	'vampires' is a good horror flick with no scares but plenty of other content to please the viewer .
POS	still , even if he doesn't always know what to do with his characters , mr . anderson most definitely captures their essences , and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious -- misguided , even aimless , hopelessly naive , self-destructive , insufferable : i loved them just the same .

POS	granted , the english subtitles got a little tough to keep up with at times ( i speak and understand french also , but some of the local colloquialisms went over my head ) , especially since the film's visuals were so intriguing that you just couldn't help but constantly gawk at them , but the general idea , the background music , the nifty french neighborhoods , the very creative way of enveloping the audience into the story-line from the start , were all very easy to appreciate , and i for one was especially glad to have seen this movie during these trying times in the world .

POS	director john mcnaughton , who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry : portrait of a serial killer , has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works .
NEG	the whole way these questions get handled are symptomatic of the movie's way of dealing with complex legal and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slam-bang fashion .
NEG	to show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters don't know about , and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown .
